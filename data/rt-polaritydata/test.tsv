0	i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man .
1	"the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun  toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout ."
2	koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
3	"waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality ."
4	"desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro ."
5	"'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach ."
6	"so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality ."
7	more trifle than triumph .
8	"you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down ."
9	"the draw [for "" big bad love "" ] is a solid performance by arliss howard ."
10	"once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else ."
11	a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .
12	i liked this film a lot . . .
13	"after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget ."
14	the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
15	there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
16	"the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters ."
17	"if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '"
18	"freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher ."
19	"bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal ."
20	there is so much plodding sensitivity .
21	"large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better ."
22	"the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters ."
23	"even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate ."
24	. . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .
25	"ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability ."
26	"the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies ."
27	"with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch ."
28	"i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing ."
29	hard to resist .
30	"sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema ."
31	"phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american ."
32	credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
33	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy .
34	"the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations ."
35	"parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place ."
36	you can practically hear george orwell turning over .
37	"as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure ."
38	"throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?"
39	intimate and panoramic .
40	davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences .
41	the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
42	"if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta ."
43	"merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone ."
44	"this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion ."
45	gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh .
46	"más sarcástica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos ."
47	"here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably ."
48	jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
49	there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter .
50	the film grows on you . and how .
51	""" the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store """
52	"harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness ."
53	"it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical ."
54	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
55	the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
56	there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x .
57	a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
58	"somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates ."
59	a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
60	. . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . .
61	is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet .
62	"take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera ."
63	"it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating ."
64	"not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time ."
65	"i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending ."
66	what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .
67	"the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven ."
68	"a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere ."
69	a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch .
70	"a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect ."
71	breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
72	this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
73	"the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack ."
74	a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists .
75	". . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments ."
76	the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
77	"a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it ."
78	"a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned ."
79	"plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king ."
80	"in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer ."
81	"dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick ."
82	"the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them ."
83	""" austin powers in goldmember "" has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end ."
84	dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?
85	"as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad ."
86	"it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress ."
87	"it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer ."
88	"the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard ."
89	it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
90	"grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte ."
91	"there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it ."
92	even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney .
93	this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .
94	"[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch ."
95	buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block .
96	. . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down .
97	"jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging ."
98	this beautifully animated epic is never dull .
99	there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live .
100	"one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career ."
101	"samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal"
102	"it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill"
103	one of the worst movies of the year .
104	"there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish ."
105	one of the best of a growing strain of daring films . . . that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
106	opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
107	"the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing ."
108	"what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy ."
109	"the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic ."
110	"too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience ."
111	shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . .
112	well-meaning but inert .
113	what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
114	it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
115	westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing .
116	rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film's short 90 minutes .
117	confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted .
118	"van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers ."
119	"a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) ."
120	the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies .
121	robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows .
122	i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings .
123	"this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment ."
124	"despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it ."
125	the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way .
126	"using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred ."
127	"the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them ."
128	"while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth ."
129	more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them .
130	"laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale ."
131	hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .
132	"the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks ."
133	there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
134	"fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care ."
135	"as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '"
136	rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . .
137	"this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer ."
138	"what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down ."
139	"scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf ."
140	"when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested ."
141	"a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania ."
142	"while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot ."
143	"an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama ."
144	resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .
145	the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread .
146	"it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' ."
147	"soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit ."
148	"amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it ."
149	"however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust ."
150	"they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right ."
151	manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
152	"even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie ."
153	"whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop ."
154	impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
155	"the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time ."
156	"the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations ."
157	"merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense ."
158	topkapi this is not .
159	like a poor man's you can count on me
160	meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
161	"going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through ."
162	"in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature ."
163	"the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality ."
164	"the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher ."
165	everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing .
166	"it's a talking head documentary , but a great one ."
167	"obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential ."
168	"all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based ."
169	an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
170	well-made but mush-hearted .
171	sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .
172	i simply can't recommend it enough .
173	a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
174	a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels .
175	"a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling ."
176	i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
177	"apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other ."
178	there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade .
179	"hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse ."
180	"though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal ."
181	"a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird ."
182	"watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart ."
183	"the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie ."
184	"a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps ."
185	"lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year ."
186	"a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire ."
187	"returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy ."
188	"world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something ."
189	"with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved ."
190	as unseemly as its title suggests .
191	'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
192	"the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged ."
193	"a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory ."
194	the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
195	there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .

197	nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin .
198	"jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) ."
199	a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
200	"aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand ."
201	a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays .
202	a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .
203	"an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century ."
204	a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
205	"there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works ."
206	"a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one ."
207	"a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection ."
208	a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
209	bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores .
210	"what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates ."
211	"it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself ."
212	"with a "" spy kids "" sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a "" snl "" has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ?"
213	more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch .
214	"beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images ."
215	anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
216	"the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back ."
217	"the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties ."
218	"apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience ."
219	characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
220	this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .
221	"except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made ."
222	a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary .
223	believability wasn't one of the film's virtues .
224	less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
225	highly engaging .
226	"for a film about explosions and death and spies , "" ballistic : ecks vs . sever "" seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies ."
227	"the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear ."
228	"i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe ."
229	has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now .
230	"shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives ."
231	another best of the year selection .
232	"not only unfunny , but downright repellent ."
233	"one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made ."
234	a delightful coming-of-age story .
235	the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .
236	"lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert ."
237	"compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder ."
238	the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
239	kinnear gives a tremendous performance .
240	"trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the "" gadzooks ! """
241	"maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors ."

243	"be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience ."
244	"i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example ."
245	to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
246	"a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise ."
247	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
248	"supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest ."

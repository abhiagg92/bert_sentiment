5283	0	a	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
3908	0	a	As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .
5224	2	a	Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .
7925	2	a	Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man 's body ?
1078	1	a	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
1060	2	a	Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
4769	2	a	So-so entertainment .
4379	3	a	It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
3397	4	a	I loved this film .
5015	0	a	The movie is a dud .
2613	1	a	This starts off with a 1950 's Doris Day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast .

6454	1	a	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
7306	1	a	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
3217	1	a	The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
5903	1	a	Unwieldy contraption .
4655	3	a	Wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .
7532	3	a	It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .
8398	1	a	Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .
5465	2	a	But this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it 's about a very human one .
2965	1	a	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
5175	1	a	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
6738	3	a	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
4782	2	a	` Enigma ' is the kind of engaging historical drama that Hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of ` We Were Soldiers . '
1083	1	a	Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .
4630	3	a	The bodily function jokes are about what you 'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie .
6456	3	a	But it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker .
4987	1	a	Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
8475	3	a	An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement .
6797	2	a	Director-writer Bille August ... depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey Martin 's deterioration and Barbara 's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .
3193	3	a	Otto-Sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .
5626	2	a	Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit

1711	3	a	An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .
4325	4	a	It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .
8411	3	a	If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
115	2	a	But when it does , you 're entirely unprepared .
3112	4	a	There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .

2868	3	a	A wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of Being John Malkovich .
1382	4	a	A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .
2949	2	a	It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
7965	0	a	The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
6844	3	a	Manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it .
3073	0	a	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .

901	0	a	Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
8121	3	a	A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
2474	3	a	Pratfalls aside , Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other .
77	2	a	Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
5514	3	a	Cold , nervy and memorable .
2538	1	a	The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
7469	3	a	Old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment .
8070	0	a	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
5039	3	a	There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .
3126	3	a	It is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band .
7213	2	a	There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
863	1	a	-LRB- A -RRB- mess .
4776	0	a	Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
2287	1	a	When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
5772	1	a	Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
981	2	a	` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
3909	1	a	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
3740	0	a	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
1491	3	a	That ` Alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon -LRB- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -RRB- ...
4166	0	a	Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
1093	1	a	Despite its Hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` Lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script .
1840	1	a	However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence .
1436	2	a	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .
3072	4	a	At once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious .
1575	2	a	Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller\/horror genre .
614	1	a	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
6162	1	a	Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
1841	2	a	The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
5589	0	a	Banal and predictable .
5179	0	a	The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
1693	0	a	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
2303	4	a	Jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .
2453	4	a	Piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
6491	2	a	It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
8074	3	a	The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
5121	4	a	It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .
6395	1	a	The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
5579	2	a	Twenty years later , Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .
6282	3	a	A great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family .
1028	2	a	Interesting , but not compelling .
5757	1	a	But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
5437	2	a	`` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
851	1	a	Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '
4411	0	a	Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
1642	3	a	It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .
5679	0	a	Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
7320	2	a	It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
1813	3	a	Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .
1384	3	a	If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .
2724	3	a	By applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject .
1937	3	a	-LRB- At least -RRB- Moore is a real charmer .
3628	3	a	... digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .
2666	4	a	This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
1940	0	a	A thriller without a lot of thrills .
199	2	a	The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .

4620	4	a	Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .
7546	4	a	A classy , sprightly spin on film .
3768	3	a	I liked this film a lot ...
6242	3	a	Efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .
3944	0	a	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
7021	1	a	Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
5487	1	a	... a rather bland affair .
5479	1	a	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
3016	1	a	is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
8343	4	a	... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .
4264	1	a	... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .
3963	4	a	Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue , the Yale grad who previously gave us `` The Skulls '' and last year 's `` Rollerball . ''
347	1	a	I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .
4222	1	a	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
7544	1	a	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
6404	1	a	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
6500	3	a	The last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful .
3779	3	a	It has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression .
5676	1	a	Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
2819	4	a	A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .
7416	2	a	Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
6281	1	a	Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .
6681	2	a	Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
8306	1	a	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
1782	0	a	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
4424	4	a	Whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of French cinema 's master craftsmen .
2685	1	a	Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
4562	3	a	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
5705	2	a	Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .
5906	3	a	In his latest effort , Storytelling , Solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .
6317	3	a	As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth .
8374	1	a	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
1759	0	a	... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
3379	2	a	Calculated swill .
6929	1	a	The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
507	1	a	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
371	4	a	`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .
4905	2	a	Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
1156	1	a	The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
3997	3	a	This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .
5577	1	a	A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
6810	3	a	While we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for Blade II .
3529	2	a	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .
40	0	a	Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
3692	1	a	Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -LRB- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -RRB- .
3257	2	a	Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
3523	4	a	The film has a terrific look and Salma Hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life .
2496	1	a	Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
6926	3	a	Both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics .
7287	2	a	There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .
4836	4	a	You 're not merely watching history , you 're engulfed by it .
8194	0	a	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
7918	3	a	Succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture .
261	1	a	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
1168	4	a	Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .
3440	3	a	The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
5364	2	a	This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
1771	4	a	... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -LRB- cool visual backmasking -RRB- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...
8192	1	a	Why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free ?
202	2	a	Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
2706	1	a	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
931	2	a	It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .
2856	4	a	I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
4006	4	a	Narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films .
289	3	a	A slight but sweet film .
461	1	a	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
6005	0	a	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
7097	3	a	Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
1188	1	a	Even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , Spy Kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .
1921	2	a	Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
6903	1	a	The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
3075	1	a	This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .
8046	4	a	Me Without You has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .
3953	0	a	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .

923	3	a	A pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .
205	4	a	Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .
2044	4	a	A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...
3745	3	a	A gorgeously strange movie , Heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers .
6030	3	a	a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
1779	0	a	Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
415	3	a	See it for his performance if nothing else .
7501	0	a	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
1488	4	a	It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
2142	2	a	Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .
5196	3	a	One of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it 's far tamer than advertised .
4985	4	a	A poignant comedy that offers food for thought .
751	1	a	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
2924	0	a	With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
7431	3	a	The little girls understand , and McCracken knows that 's all that matters .
2866	2	a	It does give you a peek .
7314	1	a	While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
2268	3	a	In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
5464	0	a	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
2884	1	a	Obvious .
7387	0	a	Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
8027	0	a	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
7354	2	a	Entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from Venus and men from Mars can indeed get together .
5510	1	a	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
288	4	a	Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
5458	2	a	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
3157	1	a	Too much of Nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
3095	3	a	You 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama .
3744	3	a	An ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre .
870	1	a	Is it a comedy ?

3659	3	a	The formula is familiar but enjoyable .
6253	2	a	That 's not vintage Spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
2435	1	a	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
4445	3	a	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
3176	4	a	A fine , rousing , G-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .

4948	1	a	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .

5499	2	a	Sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .
3535	1	a	Nevertheless , it still seems endless .
3989	3	a	While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director George Clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out .

7584	2	a	Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .

6516	0	a	The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
1827	1	a	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .

5642	4	a	As commander-in-chief of this film , Bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world .

2925	3	a	-LRB- While The Last Metro -RRB- was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while Tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history .
5698	1	a	A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
2658	3	a	For those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , Sex and Lucia may well prove diverting enough .
5933	3	a	On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10 , The Powerpuff Girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience .
5682	4	a	Bluer than the Atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie ... is , also , frequently hilarious .
3232	2	a	Abderrahmane Sissako 's Heremakono -LRB- Waiting for Happiness -RRB- is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the West African coast struggling against foreign influences .
2106	3	a	Daughter From Danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story

2046	2	a	Exposing the ways we fool ourselves is One Hour Photo 's real strength .

4746	4	a	One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .
1554	1	a	This is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one .
3362	1	a	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
6644	0	a	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
3654	1	a	There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
5159	2	a	Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .
6157	3	a	Nice piece of work .
5720	1	a	Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
707	2	a	Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
3121	1	a	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
1712	1	a	The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
5835	0	a	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .

7776	1	a	If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
6600	1	a	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
6628	1	a	A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
1699	0	a	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
3171	1	a	entertaining enough , but nothing new
3851	2	a	Though not for everyone , The Guys is a somber trip worth taking .
6834	3	a	Once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave .
2948	2	a	At times THE GUYS taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage .
3472	4	a	Sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
7808	0	a	Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum .
8437	4	a	Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
4726	3	a	waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .
6552	4	a	A stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast and 1930s horror films
5003	3	a	Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .
1238	1	a	If you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat Brussels sprouts .
8015	3	a	It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
4713	2	a	the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
297	4	a	There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
6390	2	a	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
2397	3	a	An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .
8468	0	a	A ragbag of cliches .
8303	2	a	... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .
1076	3	a	If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
8509	3	a	Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
6531	3	a	The amazing film work is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others .
7262	1	a	The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .

7380	3	a	Never once predictable .
7739	1	a	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
1581	1	a	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
5866	4	a	It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .
4292	4	a	A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun .
5703	1	a	The film is flat .
1903	2	a	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .

6064	2	a	Personal Velocity has a no-frills docu-Dogma plainness , yet Miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire .
3642	3	a	`` Brown Sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` Best Man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film .
4217	1	a	Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
1647	1	a	The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
5330	1	a	The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

5205	3	a	Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .
1448	1	a	It winds up moving in many directions as it searches -LRB- vainly , I think -RRB- for something fresh to say .
664	2	a	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
366	3	a	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
5961	3	a	It 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .
1635	2	a	An elegant film
18	1	a	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
3150	2	a	Blade II is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she 's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .

7343	4	a	Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .
3799	1	a	In the spirit of the season , I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio -- but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
258	4	a	The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
1700	4	a	Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .
1252	2	a	There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .

1613	2	a	It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
3708	2	a	Less-than-compelling documentary of a Yiddish theater clan .
2072	2	a	Gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .
4190	2	a	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
6548	4	a	Simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular New Yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy .

3748	0	a	It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
7128	3	a	Asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema 's capability for recording truth .

1991	3	a	A quaint , romanticized rendering .
7682	4	a	This is an extraordinary film , not least because it is Japanese and yet feels universal .

8047	3	a	Some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` Saving Private Ryan '' have been recreated by John Woo in this little-known story of Native Americans and their role in the second great war .
7926	3	a	How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .
3092	3	a	If villainous vampires are your cup of blood , Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .
1387	3	a	The film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition .
4581	1	a	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
4535	4	a	Spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing .

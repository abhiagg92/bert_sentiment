897	1	a	A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together .
2868	0	a	What makes Esther Kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony .
768	1	a	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
1385	1	a	The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .

1312	0	a	A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
6419	1	a	`` Frailty '' starts out like a typical Bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -LRB- and better -RRB- than most films with this theme .
3002	1	a	It 's the perfect star vehicle for Grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona .

915	1	a	The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .
5459	1	a	An excellent sequel .
1006	1	a	Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
4625	1	a	Skin Of Man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .
5195	1	a	It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .
5313	1	a	It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
3129	1	a	Bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable Italian guys .

4996	0	a	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .

166	1	a	Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process .
518	0	a	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
66	1	a	Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , Christopher Doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene 's prose , and it 's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American .
3687	1	a	The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .
6394	1	a	Hollywood Ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .
3252	1	a	After an uncertain start , Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock 's memorable first interrogation of Gosling .

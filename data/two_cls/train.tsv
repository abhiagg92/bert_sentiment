1173	0	a	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
1852	1	a	But it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .
4681	0	a	This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
3862	0	a	A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
1022	0	a	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
1751	0	a	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
3760	1	a	Late Marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love .
1859	1	a	Pretty good little movie .
2157	1	a	Writer-director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured .

2478	0	a	Imperfect ?
4532	0	a	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
3493	1	a	Fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees .
354	0	a	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
6351	0	a	The Piano Teacher is not an easy film .
3367	0	a	The modern remake of Dumas 's story is long on narrative and -LRB- too -RRB- short on action .
788	0	a	The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
3920	0	a	While Scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` Gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .
6553	0	a	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
6678	1	a	The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance .
583	0	a	Just send it to Cranky .
4317	0	a	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
3500	1	a	Rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 .
2413	0	a	What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .
167	0	a	It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
4052	0	a	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
101	1	a	A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .
964	1	a	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .
4117	0	a	All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .
4031	1	a	A witty , low-key romantic comedy .
3759	0	a	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .

2427	0	a	is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
6263	0	a	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
4395	0	a	By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
2380	0	a	But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
1688	1	a	-- but certainly hard to hate .
3539	1	a	An undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band .
2548	1	a	Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .
4377	1	a	The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .
5843	0	a	It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
1287	0	a	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
682	0	a	An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
1869	1	a	A triumph of pure craft and passionate heart .
4961	1	a	Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts
2434	1	a	What -LRB- Denis -RRB- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned .
1100	1	a	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
269	0	a	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
3788	0	a	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
626	0	a	It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
3357	1	a	The best of the Pierce Brosnan James Bond films to date .
2339	1	a	Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness .
3491	0	a	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
5927	1	a	The casting of Raymond J. Barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of Neil Burger 's impressive fake documentary .
2160	0	a	If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
5211	1	a	Psychologically savvy .
2704	0	a	Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .
2956	1	a	Sweet and memorable film .
3464	0	a	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
743	1	a	Chris Columbus ' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original .
4471	0	a	The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
6068	1	a	That , in itself , is extraordinary .
1005	1	a	unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
3558	1	a	Like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs .

2966	1	a	Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
5385	1	a	Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .
6123	1	a	`` Auto Focus '' works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the Playboy era
1048	1	a	Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .
4534	1	a	Miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet .
2575	1	a	A jaw-droppingly beautiful work
5564	0	a	It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
6823	0	a	A ragbag of cliches .
753	1	a	It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
3616	1	a	There 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .

1040	1	a	Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .
1240	0	a	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
2389	1	a	Never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .
6302	1	a	As broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , Frank Novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism .
1473	0	a	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
2563	1	a	... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .
3101	0	a	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
3951	0	a	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
744	0	a	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
3612	0	a	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
5865	0	a	Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
1756	0	a	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
2849	1	a	This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .
4463	1	a	Between them , De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .
1433	1	a	... Despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
6046	0	a	Nothing about them is attractive .
5268	0	a	What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
1806	0	a	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
4869	0	a	It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
2941	0	a	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
511	0	a	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
5277	1	a	The filmmakers wisely decided to let Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him .

3267	0	a	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
6425	1	a	Unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge .
658	0	a	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
6293	0	a	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
5282	0	a	Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .
3132	1	a	The viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful Molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers .
297	1	a	Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '
3224	1	a	It 's something of the ultimate Scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas .
6134	0	a	The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
5095	1	a	If there 's no art here , it 's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days .
1578	0	a	I ca n't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops .
2663	1	a	This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative .
6333	1	a	It 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .
428	0	a	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
1138	1	a	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
1464	1	a	Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever .
2361	1	a	Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
4203	1	a	Australia : Land Beyond Time is an enjoyable Big Movie primarily because Australia is a weirdly beautiful place .
3104	1	a	Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .
2516	0	a	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
997	0	a	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
99	1	a	Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars .
5907	1	a	Though the story ... is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament .
2841	1	a	There 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ...
4979	0	a	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
3701	0	a	I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
3011	0	a	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
4024	1	a	Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
3629	1	a	As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
813	0	a	It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
1530	0	a	More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
3275	1	a	Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` Spider-Man '' certainly delivers the goods .
224	0	a	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
2641	1	a	A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe .
4197	0	a	The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .
423	0	a	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
3112	0	a	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
1608	1	a	A French film with a more down-home flavor .
2499	1	a	It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard French film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience .
2592	0	a	Absolutely not .
1716	0	a	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
4960	1	a	Nice piece of work .
79	0	a	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
1614	0	a	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
1721	0	a	It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
3745	0	a	Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
3449	0	a	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
1839	0	a	Just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .
4494	0	a	Banal and predictable .
6131	0	a	Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
3565	1	a	works , it 's thanks to Huston 's revelatory performance .
228	0	a	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
6420	1	a	Diane Lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in Unfaithful .
2062	0	a	Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .
4900	0	a	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
3665	0	a	Could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ?
1937	0	a	By-the-numbers yarn .
2340	1	a	-LRB- Fincher 's -RRB- camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller .
1726	0	a	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
206	0	a	Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
2400	0	a	... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
1846	0	a	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .
6428	0	a	One of those so-so films that could have been much better .
287	0	a	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
5699	0	a	Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero .
3233	0	a	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
5575	1	a	The film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .
52	0	a	Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
3711	0	a	This odd , distant Portuguese import more or less borrows from Bad Lieutenant and Les Vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .
509	1	a	... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .
3231	1	a	Delight your senses and crash this wedding !
3065	0	a	One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
1158	1	a	Quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .
145	0	a	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
1267	1	a	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
807	0	a	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
546	0	a	It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
4851	1	a	If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
2760	1	a	A movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you 've actually spent time living in another community .
5349	0	a	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
3157	0	a	As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .
4523	0	a	Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .
4094	1	a	Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
2812	0	a	Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from Kathryn Bigelow , The Weight of Water is oppressively heavy .
5439	0	a	Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
1922	1	a	Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood .

4815	0	a	A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .
2078	0	a	Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
2466	1	a	more precious than perspicacious
4973	0	a	Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .

597	0	a	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .

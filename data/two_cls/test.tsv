82	Execrable .
83	"Funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , Bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking ."
84	Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .

86	A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .

120	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
121	Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .
122	Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
123	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''

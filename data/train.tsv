1086	2	a	Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .
1201	3	a	It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .
2228	3	a	The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
1508	2	a	It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .
4972	2	a	A very pretty after-school special .
2947	3	a	The film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in Laramie following the murder of Matthew Shepard .

1899	2	a	Secretary is not a movie about fetishism .
548	1	a	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
249	0	a	Black-and-white and unrealistic .
2367	1	a	Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
1058	3	a	The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
4491	1	a	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
6132	3	a	Even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .
2553	4	a	One of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .
3499	4	a	Those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them .
5032	2	a	OK arthouse .
3017	1	a	If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack .
107	2	a	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
3975	4	a	It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
1947	4	a	Real Women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way .
1773	2	a	Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic .
908	0	a	Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
7996	3	a	Even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .
5278	2	a	It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .
7524	4	a	One of the year 's best films , featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore .
1901	0	a	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
7720	1	a	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
6695	1	a	Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .
7880	1	a	Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .
5824	1	a	There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .
5409	1	a	The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
3794	1	a	-LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
6384	3	a	If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .
434	4	a	It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
7283	2	a	It is n't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems .
6387	2	a	Has its share of arresting images .
8273	3	a	In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .
1409	3	a	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
8002	4	a	Romantic comedy and Dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .
4375	4	a	A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant 's two best films -- Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones 's Diary .
4031	0	a	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
1617	1	a	The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
71	3	a	-LRB- Scherfig -RRB- has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll .
4627	4	a	While Parker and co-writer Catherine di Napoli are faithful to Melville 's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any English Lit major would have thought possible .
6481	3	a	Compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , RunTelDat is something of a triumph .
6573	2	a	It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
7669	1	a	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
7053	2	a	And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .
5861	1	a	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
401	2	a	The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .
6856	0	a	-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
3258	2	a	A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .
6032	3	a	A crisp psychological drama -LRB- and -RRB- a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` Twilight Zone '' episode .
1490	1	a	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
6630	1	a	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
2395	1	a	Lookin ' for sin , American-style ?
4303	3	a	Lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy .
5346	4	a	It is definitely worth seeing .
4748	3	a	Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this Argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
349	2	a	When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?
5166	1	a	Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
6867	2	a	Feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in Nine Queens .
7879	3	a	Claire is a terrific role for someone like Judd , who really ought to be playing villains .
7010	0	a	... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
4102	4	a	Laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma .
7603	4	a	It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .
4637	3	a	You will likely prefer to keep on watching .
1402	2	a	Ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
2514	3	a	The Cat 's Meow marks a return to form for director Peter Bogdanovich ...
5127	3	a	All three women deliver remarkable performances .
1150	2	a	Lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .
3795	1	a	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
2349	2	a	Was I scared ?
2305	2	a	in period costume and with a bigger budget .
7633	3	a	What does n't this film have that an impressionable kid could n't stand to hear ?
5117	3	a	Uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof .
5078	3	a	The film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong .
6606	4	a	E.T. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old Robert MacNaughton , 6-year-old Drew Barrymore and 10-year-old Henry Thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .
3223	1	a	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
462	4	a	A wry , affectionate delight .
6119	0	a	As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
3434	1	a	Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
5696	4	a	Canadian filmmaker Gary Burns ' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city .
932	2	a	You want to call Domino 's .
2899	3	a	-LRB- Fincher 's -RRB- camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller .
831	2	a	Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like .
1715	3	a	It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .
5331	2	a	They should have found Orson Welles ' great-grandson .
6049	4	a	The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .
4067	2	a	Um , no. .
3039	2	a	The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .
2576	3	a	It 's a quirky , off-beat project .
8479	4	a	We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .
265	2	a	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
4863	3	a	Amy and Matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it .
5486	2	a	An overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful French coming-of-age film ...
6120	3	a	Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
1871	3	a	Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .
7940	2	a	Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House .
3632	0	a	The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
6515	3	a	... an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .
3277	1	a	Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
3185	4	a	Hugh Grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in About a Boy .
5231	4	a	Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .
8240	4	a	Congrats Disney on a job well done , I enjoyed it just as much !
165	1	a	Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
1399	3	a	Everybody loves a David and Goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from David 's point of view .
2381	1	a	Sure , I hated myself in the morning .
1891	1	a	Throw Smoochy from the train !
7906	3	a	The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .
5852	4	a	An uplifting , near-masterpiece .
4432	2	a	An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
6460	1	a	Eight Legged Freaks ?
2352	2	a	A case in point : Doug Pray 's Scratch .
4625	2	a	It 's just plain boring .
4878	3	a	It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .
4959	2	a	Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
1230	1	a	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
7060	1	a	Although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a Lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of Middle America .
379	3	a	Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '
2606	3	a	A complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away .
2158	3	a	Could have been crisper and punchier , but it 's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies .
3874	4	a	Bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable Italian guys .
7608	3	a	Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
216	1	a	A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
7123	1	a	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
4294	1	a	Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
6016	0	a	This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
476	2	a	A puzzling experience .
1051	4	a	finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
840	4	a	Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .
7421	0	a	Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
416	4	a	The asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of Jia with his family .
6941	3	a	The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter .
983	3	a	`` Red Dragon '' never cuts corners .
1887	1	a	Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .
3679	3	a	There 's plenty to impress about E.T.
6934	2	a	Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
7985	3	a	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
242	3	a	At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .
5791	0	a	An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
1927	1	a	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
4900	2	a	cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers .
4132	0	a	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
816	1	a	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
1873	1	a	Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
5749	1	a	In other words , it 's just another sports drama\/character study .
8308	2	a	The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .
6902	4	a	Berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` Die Another Day '' one of the most entertaining Bonds in years
6133	3	a	And they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor .
5877	4	a	Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .
280	0	a	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
7295	3	a	And more than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation .
5060	3	a	A heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime Manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego .
1507	3	a	Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .
5874	0	a	A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
2440	4	a	If `` Lilo & Stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` Dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years .
5435	1	a	What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
1457	2	a	Steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes .
6063	2	a	The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
5941	1	a	It hates its characters .
2247	2	a	It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ?
1354	0	a	Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .
5550	4	a	This is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies .
3781	4	a	I encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry !
8380	3	a	Audacious-impossible yet compelling ...
489	4	a	Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
6827	3	a	Writer\/director Alexander Payne -LRB- Election -RRB- and his co-writer Jim Taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look American angst in the eye and end up laughing .
1034	2	a	The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
3592	3	a	Watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Hitchens ' obsession with Kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child 's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .
1691	0	a	The worst film of the year .
5820	3	a	It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on .
7293	3	a	The quirky and recessive charms of co-stars Martin Donovan and Mary-Louise Parker help overcome the problematic script .
1026	1	a	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
3079	1	a	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
2637	1	a	Nothing too deep or substantial .
370	1	a	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '
2423	3	a	An unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .
4644	1	a	Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
4267	3	a	But it is entertaining on an inferior level .
960	1	a	Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
6002	1	a	Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
444	3	a	The concept is a hoot .
3332	2	a	This is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .
5787	1	a	Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .
1836	1	a	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
2895	3	a	The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery .
4015	2	a	Critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-TV rendition of the notorious MTV show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps .
3259	4	a	The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded .
3531	2	a	Helps to remind the First World that HIV\/AIDS is far from being yesterday 's news .
6553	0	a	Abysmally pathetic
3621	3	a	Brave and sweetly rendered love story .
4066	4	a	A riveting story well told .
3835	3	a	The movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing .
4662	1	a	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
2941	0	a	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
1446	4	a	`` Red Dragon '' is entertaining .
6849	3	a	It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
2768	2	a	Y
6013	0	a	One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
6859	3	a	Provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views .
4125	2	a	A movie that at its best does n't just make the most out of its characters ' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection .
2802	1	a	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
3559	3	a	While the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course ... director John Schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades .
919	0	a	An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .
5026	3	a	A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
4342	2	a	-LRB- It -RRB- has the feel of a summer popcorn movie .
7334	1	a	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
950	1	a	With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
6924	3	a	I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
6666	1	a	The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
5110	1	a	Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
2052	3	a	The low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love .
1338	2	a	The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .
346	2	a	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
2893	4	a	Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .
2151	1	a	A moving picture that does not move .
4434	4	a	Ferrara 's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .
1280	1	a	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
7770	0	a	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
7571	3	a	But on the whole , you 're gonna like this movie .
4275	2	a	Like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate .
7927	1	a	For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .
2778	3	a	What 's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm .
6364	2	a	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
4138	1	a	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
6055	2	a	She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ...
7624	0	a	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
6662	1	a	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
5803	4	a	Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .
788	3	a	If -LRB- Jaglom 's -RRB- latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing .
3746	3	a	Its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .
6808	3	a	A worthwhile documentary , whether you 're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll .
7002	2	a	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
5842	4	a	The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .
4112	2	a	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .

3354	1	a	Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .
4661	4	a	One of the best movies of the year .
561	3	a	Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about .
435	1	a	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
4710	3	a	The movie 's seams may show ... but Pellington gives `` Mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .
5839	1	a	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
3719	4	a	The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing Kaufman has carved from Orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
405	1	a	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .
3532	3	a	Mr. Spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned .
8217	1	a	Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .
1676	2	a	At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .
842	0	a	Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
2371	1	a	An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
2421	3	a	Koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .
185	2	a	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
3369	2	a	Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .
4934	2	a	The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
6829	3	a	The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet .
2642	3	a	A low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord .
1777	4	a	One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .
7111	4	a	Schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch British actor who did not appear in Gosford Park -LRB- as well as one , Ms. Mirren , who did -RRB- , has succeeded beyond all expectation .
1560	1	a	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
5601	3	a	An affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary ...
7240	0	a	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
5153	3	a	While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .
5747	4	a	First and foremost ... the reason to go see `` Blue Crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by David Hennings .
3490	3	a	It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
3667	3	a	Her film
3214	2	a	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
2042	2	a	Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
1210	4	a	Astonishing ... -LRB- frames -RRB- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment .
2970	1	a	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
3655	1	a	The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it
5473	2	a	A drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy .
4149	3	a	Eyre is on his way to becoming the American Indian Spike Lee .
402	3	a	Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -
4720	3	a	Probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent .
2424	3	a	Neatly constructed thriller .
6916	3	a	A haunting tale of murder and mayhem .
836	2	a	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
4452	2	a	... Myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-Tarantino pop-culture riffs ...
4597	1	a	Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .
812	2	a	An ambitious and moving but bleak film .
6860	1	a	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
5053	2	a	Cynics need not apply . '
2365	3	a	It 's a talking head documentary , but a great one .
6534	4	a	That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
1926	4	a	The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two .
3611	1	a	Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?
6251	3	a	Birthday Girl does n't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .
716	4	a	Poetry in motion captured on film .
3831	3	a	-LRB- Reno -RRB- delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .
6265	2	a	The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
5957	1	a	If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .
6657	4	a	Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .
1786	1	a	Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
2892	3	a	Warm and exotic .
4827	3	a	A timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices .
3068	2	a	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
1454	2	a	Some may choose to interpret the film 's end as hopeful or optimistic but I think Payne is after something darker .
8265	4	a	Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
3565	1	a	Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
4098	1	a	The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
7807	0	a	The most repugnant adaptation
6921	3	a	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
7549	3	a	This story still seems timely and important .
2518	1	a	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
6006	4	a	A coming-of-age movie that Hollywood would n't have the guts to make .
6635	0	a	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
1370	0	a	An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
3221	4	a	Although What Time offers Tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .
8375	1	a	Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
3595	4	a	Knows how to make our imagination wonder .
5650	4	a	Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
3981	1	a	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
586	1	a	Not just unlikable .
6243	1	a	Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
4344	1	a	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
331	2	a	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .
3608	3	a	A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise .
6038	3	a	Its director 's most substantial feature for some time .
2809	3	a	You watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises .
5291	2	a	... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
2626	1	a	From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
8362	3	a	A smart little indie .
1077	1	a	-LRB- A -RRB- slummer .
5303	1	a	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
3589	1	a	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
3594	2	a	While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
4582	4	a	With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , Everett remains a perfect Wildean actor , and a relaxed Firth displays impeccable comic skill .
3031	3	a	Poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures .
1534	2	a	Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .
7453	3	a	Even if you 're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of Jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced Monty Pythonesque flavor .
504	3	a	It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
2937	4	a	There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .
1092	2	a	You can thank me for this .
4039	1	a	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
839	3	a	Here is a VH1 Behind the Music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation .
4140	2	a	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
7348	0	a	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
7347	4	a	It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
5613	3	a	A pleasing , often-funny comedy .
7109	1	a	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
7737	0	a	Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .
6693	3	a	Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .
2220	4	a	The best thing I can say about this film is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
5504	3	a	Wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of Star Wars
2653	4	a	What I saw , I enjoyed .
747	1	a	The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .
3503	1	a	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
8038	3	a	By and large this is Mr. Kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since The Doors .
56	0	a	Run for your lives !
6672	3	a	This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of .
8258	4	a	Hard , endearing , caring , warm .
2153	4	a	Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails .
7984	3	a	Unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge .
7278	2	a	Perhaps not since Nelson Eddy crooned his Indian Love Call to Jeanette MacDonald has there been a movie so unabashedly Canadian , not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest .
5340	4	a	-LRB- A -RRB- devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama .
3189	3	a	Skins has a desolate air , but Eyre , a Native American raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor .
1434	3	a	It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .
4221	3	a	-LRB- Sports -RRB- admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency .
3901	1	a	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
5131	1	a	But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won .
2361	1	a	It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless .
1526	3	a	While I ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , Stuart Little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .
1297	4	a	-LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .
325	1	a	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
2956	2	a	Earnest but heavy-handed .
6652	1	a	The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
7836	3	a	Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century .
3933	0	a	A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
2996	1	a	The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
6261	2	a	Charlize CHASES Kevin with a GUN .
5652	1	a	As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .
6835	3	a	-LRB- Has -RRB- an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 's all true .
2015	1	a	Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers .
6559	2	a	Real Women Have Curves does n't offer any easy answers .
4319	2	a	An exhilarating serving of movie fluff .
1739	1	a	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
1883	1	a	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
5592	3	a	The Chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy .
782	2	a	Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` Bedknobs and Broomsticks , '' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .
1254	2	a	LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
1272	2	a	Pedro Rodrigues '
1152	1	a	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
4999	2	a	Streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` Big Trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .
262	4	a	Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
7485	3	a	Deepa Mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of Bollywood in the Western world .
4173	1	a	The modern remake of Dumas 's story is long on narrative and -LRB- too -RRB- short on action .
4752	3	a	Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .
5494	3	a	Grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect .
4414	3	a	For his first attempt at film noir , Spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .
7311	0	a	It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
3368	0	a	There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
2193	1	a	Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
6415	3	a	As they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
1706	1	a	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
5746	1	a	Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
2720	0	a	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
6457	2	a	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
4154	3	a	I simply ca n't recommend it enough .
2588	4	a	The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
8162	0	a	You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .
5383	1	a	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
5535	2	a	Mildly entertaining .
6048	3	a	Allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today .
8521	3	a	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
4539	3	a	Intimate and panoramic .
4953	1	a	No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .
4498	2	a	Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .
3648	4	a	A much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian English title would have you believe .
3693	2	a	The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .
3974	2	a	Not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by The Piano Teacher .
5541	2	a	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
1756	2	a	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .
6512	1	a	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
448	0	a	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
2792	2	a	As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .
549	3	a	A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .
1075	4	a	Jagger , Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .
7869	4	a	an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
5619	4	a	Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years .
6973	1	a	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
4894	2	a	You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .
1190	2	a	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
2909	3	a	It 's up to -LRB- Watts -RRB- to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .
5057	1	a	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
5995	1	a	Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
3408	2	a	One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
2040	3	a	Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made , Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while .
348	2	a	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
4016	2	a	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
5401	2	a	If Signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
1679	2	a	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
7105	2	a	It 's all pretty tame .
1328	3	a	It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
8317	1	a	Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
5561	3	a	-LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting .
4151	1	a	A well-crafted letdown .
1229	1	a	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .
1267	1	a	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .
3720	2	a	Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .
5710	2	a	A witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .
1861	3	a	that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
6295	4	a	Admirers of director Abel Ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , R Xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
6816	1	a	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
1052	2	a	There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
1961	2	a	A dreary indulgence .
6337	2	a	Cinematic pratfalls given a working over .
1363	3	a	The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .
212	3	a	When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?
4967	1	a	Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
2197	4	a	One of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .
2455	3	a	Funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness .
7151	2	a	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
7514	1	a	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
2683	0	a	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
1135	2	a	The combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives Italian for Beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
5982	1	a	Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
3201	3	a	Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
5661	1	a	Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
4873	3	a	Among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations .
4927	3	a	Beautifully reclaiming the story of Carmen and recreating it an in an African idiom .
6897	2	a	13 Conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but Sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , Karen Sprecher , do n't seem ever to run out of ideas .
6366	1	a	The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
1547	0	a	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
6068	3	a	The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world .
1896	1	a	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
2557	2	a	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
7534	4	a	Surprisingly powerful and universal .
5014	1	a	-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
2611	3	a	-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
3406	1	a	He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
803	0	a	Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
3337	3	a	Symbolically , Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
152	3	a	He 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .
4157	0	a	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
6948	2	a	Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
3420	3	a	I liked it just enough .
7813	3	a	Filmmakers David Weissman and Bill Weber benefit enormously from the Cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .

3533	2	a	Flawed , but worth seeing for Ambrose 's performance .
1648	1	a	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
5602	4	a	In addition to Hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .
6726	2	a	This engrossing , characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .

4551	3	a	There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .
3288	3	a	This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .

4269	2	a	The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
3447	1	a	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
3597	2	a	A thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action .
4842	1	a	Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
4129	3	a	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams , the Spy Kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a James Bond series for kids .
8122	3	a	A dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3D goggles the theater provides .
8494	3	a	The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .
530	3	a	Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .
4033	4	a	An intoxicating experience .
3968	1	a	The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .

1219	0	a	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
5638	1	a	Often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
7518	2	a	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
1084	3	a	Family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking .
2231	3	a	A creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .
3168	3	a	The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
5374	1	a	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
4996	1	a	As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
6015	3	a	If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
5934	1	a	The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
222	0	a	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .

1956	1	a	Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .
4311	2	a	Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .
4883	3	a	This seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .

256	3	a	Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
4141	3	a	If S&M seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -LRB- and its makers ' -RRB- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .

3294	4	a	Pacino is the best he 's been in years and Keener is marvelous .
7937	0	a	Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
5376	3	a	Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings .
668	0	a	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
6118	4	a	Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .

3749	1	a	Ararat feels like a book report
99	2	a	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
2821	2	a	, with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
6737	3	a	K-19 : The Widowmaker is a great yarn .
8313	3	a	A glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism .
2067	2	a	LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
536	1	a	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
5742	4	a	Impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` Manhunter ' was .
7441	0	a	For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
6536	3	a	For all its brooding quality , Ash Wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast .

8499	0	a	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
3184	4	a	A small gem from Belgium .
322	2	a	If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .
6756	2	a	The message of such reflections -- intentional or not -- is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one .
4697	0	a	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
7681	2	a	The film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
5275	1	a	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
7159	1	a	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .

7432	0	a	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
4413	3	a	An often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .

7658	2	a	It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
2405	3	a	Part of the charm of Satin Rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness .

824	3	a	By not averting his eyes , Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .
102	2	a	Massoud 's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner -LRB- and ultimately the victim -RRB- of history .
1358	2	a	With three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
3553	2	a	Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .
6176	2	a	It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
2850	4	a	Assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong 's versatile Stanley Kwan .
8008	3	a	There is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all .
7357	2	a	A respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience .

7855	3	a	Even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold .
6786	4	a	An excellent sequel .
2080	3	a	There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
2134	1	a	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
4793	3	a	Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .
2259	3	a	Amazingly dopey .
4065	3	a	A compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds .
922	3	a	Satin Rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
5741	3	a	But even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .
6953	3	a	A real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who 's ever waited in a doctor 's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office .
5557	2	a	Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
3737	1	a	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
5892	3	a	The powerful success of Read My Lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director\/co-writer Jacques Audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers .
1146	3	a	The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .
3339	1	a	What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
2107	1	a	Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .
7763	4	a	More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .
2138	1	a	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
340	1	a	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '
8149	3	a	By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
2216	2	a	Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure .
5093	4	a	Lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , Jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
8160	0	a	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
5944	3	a	Jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism .
3097	3	a	It also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them .
6198	2	a	Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode .
3752	1	a	-LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
6203	3	a	Foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill .
3376	1	a	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
7694	3	a	Captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper .
1573	3	a	An overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .
652	2	a	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
7186	4	a	A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .
2643	1	a	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
2115	3	a	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
5232	2	a	But something seems to be missing .
987	1	a	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .

2037	4	a	This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .
8341	3	a	A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979 .
3906	3	a	I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American-Russian Armageddon .
5241	3	a	The complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary Chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we Westerners have seen before .
4757	4	a	An emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do .
3733	1	a	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
5967	1	a	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
6532	2	a	an insular world

7585	3	a	Even though it 's common knowledge that Park and his founding partner , Yong Kang , lost Kozmo in the end , you ca n't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company 's astonishing growth .
3355	1	a	Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
1478	3	a	Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .
4749	0	a	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
5841	0	a	You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
6696	4	a	The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
6632	2	a	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
5804	1	a	Less than fresh .
4025	2	a	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
7292	1	a	The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
6745	4	a	Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , Narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .
653	3	a	You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .
4521	1	a	I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .
8338	2	a	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
6409	1	a	For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .
5141	3	a	Manages to delight without much of a story .
4961	2	a	May be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since Town and Country .
7777	1	a	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
828	1	a	Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
2013	1	a	The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
2903	3	a	All right , so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny -LRB- sometimes hilarious -RRB- comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast .
8178	2	a	The Lady and the Duke is Eric Rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
2934	4	a	Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
8333	4	a	A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .
6488	2	a	Each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
274	1	a	Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
8342	0	a	Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
167	2	a	A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
1752	3	a	A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .
3468	2	a	Even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough .
3317	3	a	A high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of Berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime .
1000	1	a	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
6765	3	a	A penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination .
308	3	a	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
6112	2	a	Quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director Zhang 's last film , the cuddly Shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house .
642	1	a	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
6986	3	a	The magic -LRB- and original running time -RRB- of ace Japanimator Hayao Miyazaki 's Spirited Away survives intact in BV 's re-voiced version .
6882	1	a	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
7817	4	a	A gripping drama .
794	4	a	A well-executed spy-thriller .
1	4	a	This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
8312	1	a	The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
1373	3	a	The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .
581	1	a	Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
1919	4	a	A true-blue delight .
3950	2	a	Boldly engineering a collision between tawdry B-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , Rose 's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .
4809	1	a	Simplistic , silly and tedious .
5763	3	a	And for many of us , that 's good enough .
6901	3	a	I admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for Vincent 's complaint .
4240	1	a	At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
3551	3	a	On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny .
6073	3	a	A quirky comedy set in Newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that 's so prevalent on The Rock .
3180	4	a	... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .
3653	3	a	Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative .
4608	1	a	Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
321	0	a	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
5163	0	a	It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
1751	1	a	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
8351	4	a	Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...
7714	3	a	Frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him .
7228	1	a	Resembles a soft porn Brian De Palma pastiche .
6266	0	a	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
7871	4	a	Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
667	2	a	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
7136	3	a	Talk To Her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing .
7909	1	a	It makes me feel weird \/ Thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ Like puppies with broken legs \/ And butterflies that die \/ And movies starring pop queens
7323	2	a	If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -LRB- like , say , Treasure Planet -RRB- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , I 'll take the latter every time .
8445	0	a	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
1943	4	a	It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .
6528	2	a	Now he makes them .
6045	2	a	If you do n't flee , you might be seduced .
1049	0	a	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
1738	1	a	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .
5952	1	a	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
5137	4	a	I like this movie a lot .
8244	1	a	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
8305	2	a	There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .
483	2	a	As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .
6075	2	a	You do n't want to call the cops .
4846	1	a	The events of the film are just so WEIRD that I honestly never knew what the hell was coming next .
5322	1	a	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
3690	4	a	Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .
5598	2	a	So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .
3688	1	a	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
7923	2	a	Well-meaning but inert .
7757	3	a	This ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy -LRB- if not entirely wholesome -RRB- fun .
7392	2	a	It 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of American life .
6272	0	a	Thumbs down .
6085	0	a	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
471	3	a	Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '
4187	3	a	captures that perverse element of the Kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted `` other . ''
2443	2	a	Dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed .
8286	3	a	The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance .
5971	2	a	` The film is stark , straightforward and deadly ... an unnatural calm that 's occasionally shaken by ... blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
8448	1	a	Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
6543	2	a	Leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of Margaret Thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
224	0	a	The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
533	2	a	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
4405	4	a	Much of All About Lily Chou-Chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
4323	2	a	Goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .
954	3	a	... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .
3585	1	a	See Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .
1377	3	a	Funny and touching .
2210	0	a	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
6428	2	a	Tom Shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing Adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .
2021	1	a	Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
2307	4	a	A generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .
5392	1	a	There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .
450	2	a	Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .
1989	3	a	I liked About Schmidt a lot , but I have a feeling that I would have liked it much more if Harry & Tonto never existed .
7775	3	a	It is a likable story , told with competence .
6981	3	a	Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .
701	3	a	The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .
7391	3	a	A good thriller .
3527	2	a	The film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome .
1960	2	a	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
4165	0	a	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
6761	1	a	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
7815	1	a	Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
4997	4	a	It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
7929	4	a	But the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
1360	1	a	Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
7877	3	a	Death to Smoochy is often very funny , but what 's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito 's misanthropic vision .
4518	1	a	The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
260	2	a	A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .
564	4	a	Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .
8145	1	a	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
3751	3	a	Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work .
7838	4	a	The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
2880	3	a	An undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that 's what makes it worth a recommendation .
1645	0	a	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
8082	0	a	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
5170	1	a	about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera
7527	1	a	The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
7768	0	a	Imagine O. Henry 's The Gift of the Magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of NYC 's drug scene .
7610	3	a	Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being , The Hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .
3060	1	a	77 minutes of Pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does .
5871	1	a	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
7439	3	a	... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
8076	2	a	Heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple 's moral ascension .
2022	3	a	Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to Ichi .
1611	1	a	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
197	1	a	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
7339	2	a	In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
2550	2	a	One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .
1344	1	a	Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .

5996	3	a	Offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through .
1327	3	a	Funny in a sick , twisted sort of way .
3391	0	a	By that measure , it is a failure .

1396	4	a	What a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .
2169	2	a	Life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .
3040	0	a	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
2766	0	a	At times , it actually hurts to watch .
7081	3	a	A film of delicate interpersonal dances .
3617	4	a	The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations .
5022	1	a	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .

80	3	a	All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .
4447	0	a	Brisk hack job .
2900	2	a	The Pinochet Case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most .
3049	1	a	The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
7615	4	a	Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with Shimizu is very believable .
8004	4	a	A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age .
2580	0	a	The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
292	1	a	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
8281	3	a	The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
5670	3	a	A meatier deeper beginning and\/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` A '' range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` B + . ''

1808	4	a	Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .
4761	0	a	Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .

6479	2	a	Tony Gayton 's script does n't give us anything we have n't seen before , but director D.J. Caruso 's grimy visual veneer and Kilmer 's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .

6815	2	a	Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book .
3247	4	a	It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .
6661	1	a	Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
644	4	a	... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .

7653	2	a	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
8504	1	a	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
6381	4	a	A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .

6080	1	a	The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .
7303	1	a	It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
6980	1	a	It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .
4261	2	a	A portrait of an artist .
6993	1	a	Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script
980	1	a	It drowns in sap .
4851	1	a	This is not a Jackie Chan movie .

8415	4	a	A very charming and funny movie .
4463	4	a	Transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the X into the games .

737	1	a	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
7025	3	a	In its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as Jiri Menzel 's Closely Watched Trains and Danis Tanovic 's No Man 's Land .
2999	1	a	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
787	3	a	I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899 .
190	3	a	The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
5827	0	a	With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
7486	2	a	Tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to Liyan 's backyard .
1817	1	a	And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .
1830	2	a	would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .
6939	0	a	Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
1096	3	a	The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
5139	0	a	An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
886	2	a	A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
3045	1	a	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .
1686	3	a	Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .
2562	1	a	The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
5665	1	a	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
4859	2	a	That death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world 's religions .
4255	3	a	The banter between Calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise McLaughlin Group ... and never fails to entertain .
6955	3	a	Tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun .
5653	0	a	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
1886	1	a	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
4003	0	a	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
44	2	a	Fortunately , you still have that option .

1993	0	a	A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
6489	3	a	Nettelbeck ... has a pleasing way with a metaphor .
7411	2	a	The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .
1326	4	a	At its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .
2767	3	a	Shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept -LRB- aliens come to Earth -RRB- and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion .
2400	4	a	An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .
4747	2	a	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
7981	0	a	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
1285	1	a	Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
5497	2	a	For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .
1163	3	a	The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .
4209	0	a	The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
1263	1	a	The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
5845	1	a	Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
1963	3	a	As literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment .

7889	2	a	Go .
3195	4	a	A jaw-droppingly beautiful work
3772	1	a	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
3544	0	a	Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
6943	1	a	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
5790	1	a	Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
4007	4	a	Elegant and eloquent -LRB- meditation -RRB- on death and that most elusive of passions , love .
3270	1	a	One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
7242	3	a	The graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn Croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real .
6451	2	a	Last Dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true .
5880	0	a	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
3278	3	a	Contrived as this may sound , Mr. Rose 's updating works surprisingly well .
4932	4	a	Insanely hilarious !
8412	3	a	It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .
577	4	a	Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .
7302	2	a	Halloween : Resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been .
1781	2	a	... they missed the boat .
8361	1	a	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
2177	3	a	In its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .
3264	2	a	What Bloody Sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion .
3960	0	a	A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
5470	2	a	But not a whit more .
3773	1	a	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
3140	3	a	A smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .
1113	4	a	Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .
898	1	a	The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .
5041	3	a	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
5829	2	a	To some eyes
4392	3	a	Films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days .
6590	2	a	Grown-up quibbles are beside the point here .
5368	4	a	Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
7942	1	a	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
407	4	a	Consistently clever and suspenseful .
7321	4	a	Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience .
8438	4	a	Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .
6033	1	a	Too often , Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . ''
3361	3	a	As banal as the telling may be -- and at times , All My Loved Ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention .
6975	4	a	insightfully written , delicately performed
8329	3	a	Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
5136	3	a	It is quite a vision .
7804	1	a	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .
7542	1	a	You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
1619	1	a	The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
1316	2	a	The film truly does rescue -LRB- the Funk Brothers -RRB- from Motown 's shadows .
7426	4	a	Like Vardalos and Corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by Joel Zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake .
7936	3	a	It 's a treat watching Shaw , a British stage icon , melting under the heat of Phocion 's attentions .
2853	2	a	True Hollywood Story .
3753	2	a	Silly , loud and goofy .
891	0	a	`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .

814	3	a	Slight but enjoyable documentary .
6719	2	a	A. . .
6656	2	a	It 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' .
5645	3	a	Walter Hill 's Undisputed is like a 1940s Warner Bros. .
5931	2	a	Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
2598	1	a	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
8410	2	a	I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .
4288	1	a	They just do n't work in concert .
4494	1	a	Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .
4290	2	a	The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
1897	3	a	In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
7371	2	a	It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
2428	3	a	Cool .
1050	1	a	To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
6469	3	a	As played by Ryan Gosling , Danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction .
5270	2	a	The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .
1923	4	a	Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
1987	3	a	Clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ...
5991	1	a	Devotees of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best Next Generation episodes is lacking .
4818	1	a	Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
5476	4	a	An enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .
3586	4	a	A lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers .
6287	1	a	All mood and no movie .
1124	3	a	A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together .
8111	3	a	An elegant and sly deadpan comedy .
3911	1	a	It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
1437	1	a	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
1148	4	a	Elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .
3153	2	a	In its own way
6236	2	a	My Wife 's plotting is nothing special ; it 's the delivery that matters here .
4472	3	a	Finally , the French-produced `` Read My Lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first .
5391	2	a	The members manage to pronounce KOK exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible .
5097	1	a	Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .

6870	4	a	Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia .
770	2	a	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
7137	4	a	Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many .
3568	1	a	I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
6734	1	a	shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -LRB- but -RRB- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
6617	3	a	Drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but Turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst .

3714	4	a	-LRB- Kline 's -RRB- utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who ca n't quite live up to it .
626	0	a	It 's just rather leaden and dull .
3348	2	a	I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .
2116	4	a	A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .
2296	1	a	A lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles French , Japanese and Hollywood cultures .
3754	1	a	As underwater ghost stories go , Below casts its spooky net out into the Atlantic Ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the Bermuda Triangle .
3393	4	a	Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary .

6125	2	a	Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
1419	4	a	Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .
3204	2	a	Not bad , but not all that good .
604	0	a	Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
4146	1	a	Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
7250	4	a	This is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on Jerry Springer .
1007	2	a	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
1564	3	a	A lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .
4204	4	a	All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .
8228	1	a	After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
5282	3	a	It 's a rare window on an artistic collaboration .
1816	1	a	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
7141	4	a	Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period , no timeout .

3370	2	a	Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
7375	1	a	Sad nonsense , this .

3562	3	a	I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .
1650	3	a	The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .
3596	1	a	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
5186	2	a	Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
5305	4	a	... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative .
1480	1	a	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
5547	2	a	What ` Dumb and Dumber ' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script .
2812	0	a	Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
5569	3	a	The journey to the secret 's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough .
1443	1	a	Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
8492	3	a	Shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .
2039	3	a	We 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in Fire that makes the formula fresh again .

5075	0	a	... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
3402	1	a	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .
4904	0	a	It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
7024	1	a	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .

6485	3	a	A knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor .

3928	3	a	It 's definitely a step in the right direction .
3229	2	a	As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink .
174	2	a	... the one thing this Wild film has that other Imax films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house .
6791	0	a	A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
5983	1	a	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
4917	1	a	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
4864	1	a	One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
50	1	a	Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .
7785	1	a	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
252	3	a	Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .
3895	1	a	You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .
423	3	a	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
4265	3	a	Not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching .
7901	0	a	Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
1775	3	a	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
3913	1	a	We just do n't really care too much about this love story .
6775	4	a	Twenty years later , E.T. is still a cinematic touchstone .
1505	0	a	A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
620	3	a	It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .
6308	1	a	Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?
8276	1	a	Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
5348	1	a	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
4475	2	a	While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .
2747	1	a	The modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .
7673	0	a	The Paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -LRB- restored -RRB- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .

5325	2	a	just pile up .
8282	0	a	In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .
3227	1	a	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
5518	2	a	It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
8364	0	a	Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
72	3	a	-LRB- An -RRB- absorbing documentary .
1348	0	a	This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .

884	0	a	An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
5968	1	a	A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .
5684	3	a	In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
5427	3	a	The best film of the year 2002 .
2848	1	a	PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
4214	2	a	A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance .
3255	3	a	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
6883	2	a	The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
3969	2	a	`` Punch-Drunk Love '' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache ...
7533	1	a	... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
4093	1	a	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .

4738	2	a	Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .
1359	0	a	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .

2362	1	a	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
2512	2	a	It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
1087	4	a	Charlie Hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a Dickensian hero .
3917	2	a	One of the film 's most effective aspects is its Tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .

571	4	a	Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .

3200	4	a	This is a movie you can trust .
8144	0	a	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
1588	2	a	Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .

8005	3	a	Rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ...
7635	3	a	What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice .
8439	2	a	The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .

5878	1	a	The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
1193	1	a	Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
7747	4	a	Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale .

6034	1	a	It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .

4081	1	a	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
8112	2	a	With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
6117	3	a	What `` Empire '' lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart .
24	2	a	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
1025	4	a	Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .

2353	1	a	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
1313	2	a	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .
4086	4	a	The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .
183	3	a	The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .
2855	2	a	` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied .

4607	4	a	This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in Morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .

8471	1	a	Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .
7905	1	a	Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .

4755	3	a	It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .
2123	3	a	-LRB- City -RRB- reminds us how realistically nuanced a Robert De Niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` Analyze This ' -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and ` Analyze That , ' promised -LRB- or threatened -RRB- for later this year .

6234	1	a	There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
5054	2	a	An involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings .
3600	4	a	Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .

234	0	a	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
6142	1	a	Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
1872	2	a	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
5735	1	a	... less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population 's shrugging acceptance to each new horror .
6506	3	a	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
6449	1	a	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
4702	1	a	What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .

1663	4	a	A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .
8063	3	a	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
2370	3	a	Cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of Denmark 's Dogma movement .
5784	3	a	Crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half .
4787	2	a	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .

3222	3	a	It 's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience .
656	4	a	So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .
1666	4	a	But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .
335	1	a	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
2633	3	a	An unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood .

6461	3	a	Fierce , glaring and unforgettable .
6480	1	a	The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
4145	2	a	Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
3188	1	a	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
1364	3	a	As Hannibal would say , yes , ` It 's like having an old friend for dinner ' .
6058	0	a	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .

6042	2	a	If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
989	3	a	It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
3154	0	a	The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
6483	3	a	While not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the National Lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .
5452	2	a	It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it .
7860	1	a	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
5007	4	a	It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .
6503	0	a	But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
4365	2	a	Anyone else seen this before ?

5069	1	a	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
3041	2	a	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
4933	0	a	There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
6598	3	a	It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
6220	2	a	It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .
5495	4	a	Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
1889	3	a	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .
1877	1	a	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
945	1	a	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
6643	1	a	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
7587	2	a	When the violence actually shocked ?
451	1	a	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .
5599	1	a	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
1577	4	a	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .

7449	3	a	This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .

8242	2	a	Big time .
6605	2	a	You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
2656	0	a	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
4725	1	a	It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .
7307	2	a	Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
4069	4	a	Features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever .
1256	2	a	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
2281	1	a	More tiring than anything .
8233	3	a	A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .
5061	2	a	If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
7239	3	a	K 19 stays afloat as decent drama\/action flick
5471	1	a	It 's not a great monster movie .
6592	1	a	A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
4981	0	a	The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
8335	3	a	Michel Piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being .
1856	2	a	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .
7784	3	a	The locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches .
7026	4	a	But the performances of Pacino , Williams , and Swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .
1743	3	a	For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .
1557	2	a	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
4638	2	a	-LRB- Garbus -RRB- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
879	1	a	Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
7488	1	a	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .
2727	2	a	It never is , not fully .
2826	3	a	Mordantly funny and intimately knowing ...
2378	0	a	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
3793	3	a	You live the mood rather than savour the story .
1179	3	a	Wow , so who knew Charles Dickens could be so light-hearted ?
7806	3	a	The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .
4167	0	a	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
4636	2	a	Either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks .
3850	3	a	Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
6406	1	a	The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
4866	4	a	A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses Grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos .
3363	0	a	The thing just never gets off the ground .
7988	1	a	Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
1293	4	a	Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before .
1340	2	a	But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .
2084	3	a	Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most .
4843	0	a	It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
2484	2	a	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
1132	4	a	... is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness -LRB- the way Chekhov is funny -RRB- , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality .
541	1	a	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
2324	0	a	This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
3669	3	a	And the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .
482	3	a	The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
63	3	a	The characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films .
5958	2	a	Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .
8480	0	a	Disgusting .
207	3	a	Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process .
5066	1	a	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
8157	1	a	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
6362	1	a	It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
556	1	a	Make Chan 's action sequences boring .
5898	1	a	For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .
7460	2	a	I prefer to think of it as `` Pootie Tang with a budget . ''
5151	1	a	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
7712	4	a	The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other .
5263	3	a	Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants .
7798	3	a	Maryam is more timely now than ever .
6067	1	a	Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
1479	3	a	Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .
85	1	a	Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .
5942	3	a	So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .
5056	4	a	Bouquet gives a performance that is masterly .
2898	3	a	Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness .
2454	1	a	-LRB- Stevens is -RRB- so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
2711	3	a	Compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get .
5177	3	a	The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight are just two of the elements that will grab you .
1342	2	a	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
6885	1	a	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
4898	3	a	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
5796	0	a	... unbearably lame .
6959	0	a	Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
8001	4	a	It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
8484	3	a	It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
4653	3	a	Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .
7399	1	a	Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .
459	1	a	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
2661	0	a	A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
1737	3	a	Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '
4876	3	a	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
96	0	a	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
3399	0	a	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
5242	1	a	Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .
1378	0	a	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
7202	1	a	The film is strictly routine .
6116	3	a	Byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle .
876	0	a	` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .
5761	2	a	The farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .
5223	3	a	Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
1975	3	a	Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
3758	1	a	Heavy with flabby rolls of typical Toback machinations .
1529	0	a	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
8050	1	a	There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
6846	3	a	Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in .
3976	0	a	The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
3537	1	a	The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
8080	3	a	Fred Schepisi 's tale of four Englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .
3	3	a	A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .
7414	2	a	It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive .
2533	4	a	Hailed as a clever exercise in neo-Hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately Chabrolian .
4388	1	a	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
5453	4	a	` Anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
4641	3	a	A certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents .
790	4	a	The movie is a trove of delights .
4819	2	a	If horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like .
3509	3	a	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
786	1	a	Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
336	2	a	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
646	0	a	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
4950	1	a	Yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...
140	0	a	Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
3459	3	a	He has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper .
3921	4	a	Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
6274	0	a	The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
316	4	a	Except it 's much , much better .
1085	4	a	A poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
6208	3	a	They are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre .
1356	0	a	In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
4213	2	a	The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .
1184	4	a	A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
7509	2	a	` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '
6909	3	a	Whatever complaints I might have , I 'd take -LRB- its -RRB- earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like Antwone Fisher or The Emperor 's Club any time .
8405	1	a	Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .
141	3	a	-LRB- Cho 's face is -RRB- an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots .
3482	4	a	It 's that good .
8280	1	a	Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
2004	3	a	Captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world .
2069	3	a	I 've never bought from telemarketers , but I bought this movie .
7178	1	a	We get the comedy we settle for .
6407	0	a	The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
6319	3	a	That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .
3062	3	a	more precious than perspicacious
315	2	a	Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .
6667	2	a	Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
241	0	a	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
3228	3	a	A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .
5310	1	a	Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
4542	3	a	It is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .
5068	3	a	This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci-fi genre .
7583	3	a	A polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con .
5956	2	a	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
5047	2	a	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .
6855	4	a	Funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , Bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking .
6875	0	a	-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
3912	0	a	A chiller resolutely without chills .
5979	0	a	There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
7732	2	a	Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
1506	4	a	One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...
6777	2	a	Red Dragon is less baroque and showy than Hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than Silence .
6268	0	a	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
5773	0	a	About as enjoyable , I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .
3423	0	a	The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
3723	3	a	-LRB- F -RRB- rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels .
7939	3	a	Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
2595	4	a	It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
3367	4	a	One of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever .
7350	4	a	A slick , engrossing melodrama .
6831	4	a	A delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a Copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them .
7661	0	a	... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .
8147	0	a	It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
2363	1	a	Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken
7404	3	a	An amused indictment of Jaglom 's own profession .
3662	4	a	Sweet and memorable film .
2548	3	a	What redeems the film is the cast , particularly the Ya-Yas themselves .
2310	2	a	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
3872	4	a	Return to Never Land is reliable , standard Disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages .
4420	1	a	Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .
8254	3	a	The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .
1930	1	a	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
4124	0	a	The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
4208	2	a	The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
8247	3	a	A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and Japanese animation .
3346	1	a	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
4009	1	a	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
380	4	a	Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .
8269	2	a	The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
7155	1	a	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
2744	0	a	... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .
1654	4	a	This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .
7640	2	a	Very well made , but does n't generate a lot of tension .
6473	2	a	Disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , Tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .
5573	3	a	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
5258	2	a	Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
6374	3	a	Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .
1979	3	a	An enjoyable above average summer diversion .
3504	4	a	Not since Ghostbusters has a film used Manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .
7922	1	a	Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt .
5407	3	a	`` Mr. Deeds '' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought .
6209	3	a	Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .
1243	3	a	This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .
5308	1	a	can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
5393	1	a	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
4895	1	a	If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
5686	3	a	Everything about The Quiet American is good , except its timing .
8284	1	a	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
3469	1	a	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
6707	1	a	This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
2419	4	a	That 's fun for kids of any age .
1262	3	a	Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
8210	4	a	An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .
3077	3	a	The film grows on you .
2180	3	a	Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but Coppola , along with his sister , Sofia , is a real filmmaker .
1072	3	a	A compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her .
129	4	a	A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .
8200	4	a	Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen .
2875	1	a	The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
7229	1	a	So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
3843	1	a	Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
6612	1	a	Painfully padded .
2456	0	a	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
6110	1	a	Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
7531	2	a	Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
5565	2	a	The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
5620	4	a	It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
6158	4	a	Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts
191	1	a	It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
7150	1	a	There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but Brooms is n't it .
7280	1	a	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
3187	3	a	For proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that Spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .
7095	2	a	Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .
7917	4	a	Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , Haneke 's portrait of an upper class Austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
5235	0	a	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
3158	1	a	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
5632	0	a	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
4651	1	a	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
2913	3	a	a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
4838	1	a	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .
1895	1	a	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
78	1	a	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
497	3	a	She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .
1023	2	a	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
1539	1	a	An ugly , revolting movie .
5332	3	a	It offers a glimpse of the Solomonic decision facing Jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
7539	3	a	It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
2251	2	a	A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
1855	0	a	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
2124	3	a	would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` The French Lieutenant 's Woman . '
2991	0	a	Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
4844	2	a	I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but

237	4	a	... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
5628	3	a	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
4188	1	a	It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .

3019	3	a	Spare but quietly effective retelling .
2647	3	a	The real triumphs in Igby come from Philippe , who makes Oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and Sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable WASP matron .
6302	2	a	The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
334	3	a	The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .

4832	0	a	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
3644	4	a	Astonishingly skillful and moving ... it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one .
5033	3	a	The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .
4315	3	a	So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
2922	0	a	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
6675	0	a	Horrible .

5397	0	a	This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
4546	4	a	There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .
1614	3	a	One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .
3726	3	a	Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .
7852	0	a	In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .

6482	1	a	... Watching it was painful .
6968	4	a	Highly engaging .
8253	1	a	It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
689	1	a	Paul Cox needed to show it .
6192	1	a	Not even Solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
2119	0	a	Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .
2664	1	a	But it was n't .
8068	0	a	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
7551	0	a	Just plain bad .
7299	3	a	Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .
7505	1	a	A muted freak-out
3832	1	a	The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
2386	0	a	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
4867	3	a	Spielberg 's picture is smarter and subtler than -LRB- Total Recall and Blade Runner -RRB- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .
2918	4	a	More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
7956	1	a	the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
4508	3	a	Deflated ending aside , there 's much to recommend the film .
3685	3	a	An uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from American cinema .
4408	1	a	It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill

1972	0	a	is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
4439	1	a	Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
6760	4	a	A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
5745	2	a	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
8283	4	a	A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry .
7059	1	a	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .

6868	0	a	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
3940	3	a	The director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of Truffaut .
4373	2	a	Twist open the Ouzo !
6891	3	a	As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine .
2843	1	a	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .

6554	4	a	The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago .
6433	0	a	Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
8372	0	a	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
7395	3	a	It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
728	1	a	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
3061	4	a	a joyous occasion
490	0	a	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
1088	4	a	Measured against practically any like-themed film other than its Oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor The Silence of the Lambs , Red Dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .
5306	1	a	He fails .
4111	3	a	This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives The Lady and the Duke something of a theatrical air .
92	1	a	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
3894	1	a	This u-boat does n't have a captain .
5428	4	a	A moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
399	3	a	Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .
1059	3	a	Its sheer dynamism is infectious .
3522	1	a	In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
1142	1	a	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
1341	1	a	Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
635	3	a	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential
962	3	a	Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .
400	2	a	A porn film without the sex scenes .
3612	4	a	Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery .
2688	4	a	Informative , intriguing , observant , often touching ... gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms .
4918	0	a	Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
3487	1	a	For a film that 's being advertised as a comedy , Sweet Home Alabama is n't as funny as you 'd hoped .
2838	3	a	The lightest , most breezy movie Steven Spielberg has made in more than a decade .

5734	2	a	`` What really happened ? ''
4902	0	a	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
2096	3	a	Visually striking and viscerally repellent .
3588	2	a	A well-acted , but one-note film .
5434	4	a	A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .
7408	2	a	A mess , but it 's a sincere mess .
4913	3	a	-LRB- Gosling 's -RRB- combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character .
4696	4	a	-LRB- Taymor -RRB- utilizes the idea of making Kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work .
995	0	a	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
108	4	a	Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power .
7203	4	a	Features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film .
3691	3	a	It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .
2323	3	a	There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
5341	1	a	A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
1227	3	a	Other than the slightly flawed -LRB- and fairly unbelievable -RRB- finale , everything else is top shelf .
7090	3	a	This time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .
2716	2	a	Funny , though .
1154	1	a	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
3812	4	a	Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .
4089	1	a	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
3683	3	a	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
2230	0	a	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
8140	3	a	Sorvino is delightful in the central role .
1159	1	a	A cockeyed shot all the way .
3823	1	a	While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
5492	2	a	It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate .
420	4	a	It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
3333	4	a	Smart and taut .
6169	2	a	Shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause Tom Green a grimace ; still , Myer 's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
2523	2	a	This sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .
8104	2	a	Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
2674	3	a	It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .
4629	1	a	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
6338	3	a	Talk to Her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching .
3437	1	a	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
2087	4	a	It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .
6684	2	a	Wow , a jump cut !
6587	1	a	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
7666	3	a	Marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula .
139	3	a	Sleek and arty .
1369	4	a	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
4780	0	a	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
2746	2	a	What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .
1131	4	a	Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
8503	3	a	Has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of B-movie excitement .
7386	3	a	The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations .
8238	2	a	A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
7814	2	a	Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .
4014	3	a	It 's enough to watch Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins .
624	2	a	Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; falls short of First Contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a nose -RRB- ahead of Generations .
844	4	a	The Bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they 've told a nice little story in the process .
4613	3	a	You 've already seen City by the Sea under a variety of titles , but it 's worth yet another visit .
67	1	a	It 's like a drive-by .
4193	2	a	An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
4789	1	a	A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
5036	2	a	It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
539	1	a	Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
703	1	a	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
4481	4	a	delightfully rendered
3026	3	a	It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .
4322	3	a	Antwone Fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it .
3601	2	a	You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
854	1	a	It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
2582	2	a	Every child 's story is what matters .
7360	0	a	Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
2059	1	a	Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .
4756	1	a	It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see .
3484	3	a	If you like peace , you 'll like Promises .
3117	0	a	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
1244	4	a	Kinnear ... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers .
5259	4	a	Mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully .
8440	1	a	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
5496	2	a	There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .
6699	1	a	Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion .
3102	2	a	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment
3713	4	a	A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
5418	3	a	A thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy .
2781	4	a	Better effects , better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh .
7101	2	a	Much of the digitally altered footage
2858	3	a	Any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look .
3687	2	a	The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...
7919	2	a	It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?
4019	4	a	As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .
5271	1	a	Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .
3573	0	a	I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...
182	3	a	Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fall 's `` Heist '' so much fun .
2117	3	a	It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .
189	0	a	The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
1309	3	a	Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
4921	1	a	A noble failure .
1834	4	a	Intriguing and stylish .
5724	1	a	A big fat pain .
7856	2	a	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
3775	0	a	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
7225	4	a	The film 's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them .
5178	3	a	Some Body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .
61	3	a	But arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .
4056	0	a	After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
1257	1	a	You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` Simone , '' and consider a DVD rental instead .
7800	3	a	The Ring never lets you off the hook .
1485	0	a	A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
2568	1	a	Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .
1167	2	a	I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .
522	3	a	Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .
7264	3	a	We 've seen it all before in one form or another , but director Hoffman , with great help from Kevin Kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher .
4839	1	a	The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
8307	1	a	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
7344	1	a	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
1831	0	a	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
4181	1	a	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
6789	1	a	prechewed
7200	1	a	... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
1858	1	a	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
562	1	a	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
3210	3	a	Bravado Kathy !
776	3	a	A gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
4286	3	a	Ludicrous , but director Carl Franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining .
4682	0	a	It 's Splash without the jokes .
6029	3	a	The casting of von Sydow ... is itself Intacto 's luckiest stroke .
7736	3	a	The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .
7609	4	a	Griffin & Co. manage to be spectacularly outrageous .
5229	3	a	Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .
3283	0	a	On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
111	1	a	And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .
6332	3	a	If there 's no art here , it 's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days .
1632	4	a	One of the funnier movies in town .
3736	0	a	As it is , it 's too long and unfocused .
2446	0	a	The Master of Disguise is awful .
6130	2	a	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
1079	1	a	The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
7448	1	a	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
1741	0	a	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
5596	2	a	A perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film .
918	3	a	Davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as Amy .
2944	2	a	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
3881	1	a	If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
4548	2	a	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
4279	4	a	-LRB- Hayek -RRB- throws herself into this dream Hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with Molina and she gradually makes us believe she is Kahlo .
3763	0	a	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
421	1	a	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
188	2	a	The result might look like Vulgar .
3054	0	a	Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .
4156	1	a	A negligible British comedy .
4426	0	a	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
2730	2	a	But fans of the show should not consider this a diss .
6350	1	a	Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .
5352	0	a	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
1171	0	a	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
1091	1	a	... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
7083	2	a	In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
74	1	a	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
619	4	a	Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .
4885	2	a	Noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism .
2977	1	a	You do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace .
3852	4	a	Top-notch action powers this romantic drama .
2277	4	a	A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .
3349	3	a	As a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron is a winner .
5445	0	a	The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
7099	4	a	Drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , Byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth .
7147	3	a	It thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -LRB- Jaglom -RRB- pursued with such enervating determination in Venice\/Venice .
7271	3	a	The movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle .
6090	2	a	The vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .
4559	1	a	And in a sense , that 's a liability .
6839	3	a	There 's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something .
8510	1	a	None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
296	4	a	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .
1878	1	a	Why ?
1121	1	a	`` -LRB- Hopkins -RRB- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .
1130	4	a	Matthew Lillard is born to play Shaggy !
1851	2	a	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
493	2	a	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .
5444	2	a	Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .
7756	2	a	A melancholy , emotional film .
7442	1	a	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
5353	1	a	The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
5482	0	a	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
1968	1	a	Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
5623	0	a	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
2901	2	a	However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
1063	1	a	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
1407	4	a	A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .
5766	1	a	Though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way K-19 jettisoned some crucial drama .
2699	2	a	Unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
4856	3	a	Not quite as miraculous as its DreamWorks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .
573	1	a	The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
4231	3	a	`` Nicholas Nickleby '' is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there 's no new `` A Christmas Carol '' out in the theaters this year .
3167	2	a	The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .
3206	2	a	Triumph of Love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree .
1511	3	a	Jackson is always watchable .
7613	3	a	Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
7100	3	a	A moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives .
1714	0	a	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
5171	0	a	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
1875	1	a	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
2982	2	a	I prefer Soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .
7818	4	a	Darkly funny and frequently insightful .
1127	4	a	One of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .
1412	4	a	The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .
4301	1	a	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
8490	3	a	It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
3249	4	a	It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .
5338	1	a	This New Zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .
6538	3	a	All in all , a great party .
3684	4	a	It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .
2263	0	a	The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
2082	2	a	It bites hard .
5715	0	a	Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
3099	0	a	It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
1620	2	a	... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .
7403	1	a	One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
7436	3	a	Overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances .
7336	3	a	Though the story ... is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament .
7212	1	a	The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
8248	2	a	Oozes condescension from every pore .
2282	3	a	If you 're not , you 'll still have a good time . ''
3637	0	a	A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
8514	3	a	The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .
7881	1	a	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ;
1352	4	a	A beautifully observed character piece .
5422	1	a	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
4078	4	a	The film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant .
857	1	a	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
7397	3	a	The performances are uniformly good .
5783	3	a	Reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others .
3401	3	a	Nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book .
4130	1	a	Something must have been lost in the translation .
8083	1	a	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
800	3	a	Gives an intriguing twist to the French coming-of-age genre .
612	3	a	You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .
5850	2	a	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
7572	0	a	For dance completists only .
6214	2	a	Just watch Bettany strut his stuff .
5351	0	a	This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
3892	3	a	This is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a Friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .
475	1	a	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
1742	1	a	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
3580	1	a	They cheapen the overall effect .
6194	3	a	Another entertaining romp from Robert Rodriguez .
7561	2	a	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
982	4	a	A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude .
8105	2	a	As happily glib and vicious as its characters .
7145	3	a	Very predictable but still entertaining
4704	4	a	The story ... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is .
6690	0	a	Without Shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
8377	1	a	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
3609	2	a	The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
2804	1	a	This is not an easy film .
3988	3	a	Payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle America and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human .
775	1	a	Upper Teens may get cynical .
6394	0	a	One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
6222	4	a	It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
1225	3	a	Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .
2687	1	a	I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
6663	1	a	Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
648	0	a	It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
208	2	a	... only Bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction .
4686	3	a	I 've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .
5831	4	a	That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .
5610	3	a	Hard to resist .
7138	3	a	It may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but I enjoyed Barbershop .
7000	3	a	I have a new favorite musical -- and I 'm not even a fan of the genre
567	3	a	It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
905	2	a	They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
5672	4	a	A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others .
4706	4	a	Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .
4798	0	a	It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
1719	1	a	This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
7887	3	a	-LRB- Clooney 's -RRB- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh .
7744	2	a	A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
7846	4	a	Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino 's performance .
5738	1	a	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
508	4	a	I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .
6579	2	a	Consider this review life-affirming .
2524	1	a	Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
6762	1	a	Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
2016	0	a	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
4946	0	a	-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
4459	3	a	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
7015	1	a	Everything is off .
2515	1	a	The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
1734	3	a	You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .
7232	4	a	Just like a splendid meal , Red Dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
5111	3	a	From its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , Martin is a masterfully conducted work .
3314	0	a	The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
4395	3	a	There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
2321	2	a	Just plain silly .
2278	3	a	From both a great and a terrible story , Mr. Nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .
6418	4	a	It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
1403	3	a	It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .
2111	4	a	Good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing .
4514	4	a	A compelling pre-WWII drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .
488	3	a	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .
552	3	a	The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .
2686	3	a	Sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be .
4887	4	a	Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold .
6994	1	a	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .
8391	3	a	Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin .
7599	2	a	One of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way .
3089	3	a	... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun .
6514	4	a	If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .
2304	1	a	Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .

7036	4	a	Vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of Mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .
4385	2	a	Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .
8462	1	a	Woefully pretentious .

4184	4	a	Exciting and well-paced .
5506	3	a	Aside from Rohmer 's bold choices regarding point of view , The Lady and the Duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art .
874	3	a	An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .

5516	0	a	Nothing about this movie works .
3042	1	a	It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
5713	2	a	No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
2017	3	a	Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell .
1692	1	a	` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
3511	1	a	Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
5571	2	a	Greengrass -LRB- working from Don Mullan 's script -RRB- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
360	3	a	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .
3570	2	a	A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .
5466	1	a	There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
7400	4	a	More intimate than spectacular , E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
4200	3	a	Broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed .

912	2	a	Opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .
6615	2	a	This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .
389	1	a	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
406	2	a	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
2537	2	a	The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
2114	4	a	Beautifully produced .
5629	1	a	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

2387	0	a	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .

5040	3	a	Director Paul Cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding .
3462	2	a	A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .
3345	4	a	What 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director 's talent .
3990	3	a	All leather pants & augmented boobs , Hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching Sarandon .
3064	3	a	Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway .
5543	3	a	Director Todd Solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates .
5890	4	a	An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .

1222	1	a	The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .
6459	4	a	Young Hanks and Fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
4733	1	a	Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .
6807	2	a	More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .
4497	1	a	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
2209	4	a	It 's never dull and always looks good .
4635	1	a	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
4667	3	a	Despite a quieter middle section , involving Aragorn 's dreams of Arwen , this is even better than The Fellowship .
382	0	a	This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
695	2	a	A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .
4338	3	a	Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
4599	1	a	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .

8103	2	a	This is amusing for about three minutes .
3639	1	a	The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- Muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but it 's smooth and professional .
2375	1	a	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
3815	3	a	A beautiful paean to a time long past .
6709	1	a	`` White Oleander , '' the movie , is akin to a Reader 's Digest condensed version of the source material .
8261	1	a	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
1949	2	a	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
8414	1	a	That 's its first sign of trouble .
1793	1	a	... a bland , pretentious mess .
3888	3	a	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
1406	4	a	Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
5817	1	a	While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''
855	0	a	There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .
8425	2	a	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
3802	1	a	This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .
4273	0	a	To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
3069	4	a	That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .
946	4	a	This is a very funny , heartwarming film .
7630	2	a	The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be .
887	4	a	Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
155	3	a	In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
3467	4	a	The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates .
3949	3	a	Far From Heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it 's a work of enthralling drama .

1597	3	a	, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .
2837	2	a	For all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , Blood Work is a strong , character-oriented piece .

6513	4	a	One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
8181	2	a	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
8353	2	a	Anyone who 's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved .

3951	2	a	The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
7791	2	a	Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .

6840	3	a	Mention `` Solaris '' five years from now and I 'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share .
1999	4	a	The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .
5375	3	a	... a solid , unassuming drama .
3546	2	a	By the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .
3896	3	a	A little better than Sorcerer 's Stone .
3449	4	a	Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .
5358	0	a	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
3681	3	a	What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
1528	3	a	The Chateau belongs to Rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting French malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot .
7214	1	a	The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
5489	0	a	... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
763	3	a	It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
7670	1	a	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
5849	1	a	Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .
3689	0	a	Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
3021	2	a	Though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .
3389	3	a	A sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one 's mother .
6231	3	a	Then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up Twin Peaks action ...
6782	3	a	Khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .
398	1	a	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .

5818	3	a	As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .
1958	2	a	Ruh-roh !
7268	1	a	It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
1826	0	a	For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
1302	3	a	I 'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up .
1796	1	a	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
6879	2	a	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
1459	4	a	Jeffrey Tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is Oscar-worthy .
7269	2	a	Humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .
7916	4	a	But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .
2284	3	a	On the surface a silly comedy , Scotland , PA would be forgettable if it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play .
1905	1	a	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
6925	3	a	For the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .
3649	3	a	The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .
1231	4	a	Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .
1962	1	a	A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .
7598	0	a	The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
827	1	a	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
4591	1	a	I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
4594	4	a	A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity .
811	2	a	Bernal and

4266	0	a	This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
3148	4	a	Exciting documentary .
3973	3	a	Whether or not Ram Dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , Fierce Grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one .
154	1	a	... stale and uninspired .
3163	4	a	Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .
8370	4	a	A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an M-16 .
3058	1	a	Incoherence reigns .
7680	2	a	At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .

4158	4	a	In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
5635	4	a	borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .

3324	2	a	Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
5712	3	a	A thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world .
6170	3	a	Murderous Maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by Testud ... and Parmentier .
5462	3	a	Ultimately , `` MIB II '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless .
6227	0	a	Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
3755	4	a	A moving and important film .

4	1	a	Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
6555	2	a	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
7912	3	a	It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
5988	3	a	The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema .

4134	1	a	There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... -LRB- b -RRB- ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .
3059	4	a	The wanton slipperiness of \* Corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .
1192	2	a	Wait for it to hit cable .
1602	1	a	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
1311	4	a	-LRB- Washington 's -RRB- strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene .

4822	2	a	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .
121	2	a	Absorbing character
4770	1	a	Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
582	2	a	The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , Jean Reno , who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .
791	1	a	With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...

1790	3	a	While there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't .

5500	3	a	The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .
2980	2	a	It says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense .

5625	3	a	The pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies .
3412	3	a	Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
2437	3	a	-LRB- There 's -RRB- quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin .

2558	3	a	Jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .
5385	1	a	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
1153	2	a	The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
6850	1	a	A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .
641	3	a	Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .
3302	0	a	This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .

5424	3	a	Alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous .
4871	2	a	A chick flick for guys .
7619	3	a	It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .

7017	0	a	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
350	2	a	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .
2987	1	a	A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
4256	4	a	The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...

1054	0	a	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
2607	0	a	The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
7973	3	a	If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .

2024	4	a	An enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
3777	2	a	There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .
2302	3	a	Starts slowly , but Adrien Brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying .
5546	4	a	Between them , De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .
4339	3	a	Fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees .
2590	0	a	Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .
2785	1	a	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
128	2	a	A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .

6720	3	a	Jae-eun Jeong 's Take Care of My Cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the South Korean cinema .
7643	1	a	This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
4886	2	a	It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
2774	0	a	A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
6784	4	a	A film centering on a traditional Indian wedding in contemporary New Delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but Mira Nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences .

5481	3	a	American musical comedy as we know it would n't exist without the precedent of Yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of Broadway .
8419	0	a	A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
5456	4	a	Adaptation is simply brilliant .
1925	2	a	It 's not hateful .
2174	2	a	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
3633	2	a	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
4248	3	a	Family fare .

3495	1	a	`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .
772	3	a	Charlotte Sometimes is a gem .
7573	2	a	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
6202	1	a	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
4974	3	a	This real-life Hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies Hollywood produces .

1568	0	a	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
3009	0	a	The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
3903	3	a	With the prospect of films like Kangaroo Jack about to burst across America 's winter movie screens it 's a pleasure to have a film like The Hours as an alternative .
1561	1	a	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .
6770	0	a	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
917	2	a	While this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
7092	2	a	We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .
1684	1	a	The movie is well done , but slow .

116	3	a	Devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower .
4462	1	a	It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
762	3	a	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .
7418	1	a	Although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success .
4097	2	a	The kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . .
8159	3	a	Singer\/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
5148	2	a	Eric Byler 's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations ...
3203	3	a	-LRB- `` Safe Conduct '' -RRB- is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage .
1522	4	a	The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .
3050	0	a	It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
2293	1	a	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
588	3	a	Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a Japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation .
1948	3	a	And it is .
6581	2	a	Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
5410	3	a	-LRB- D -RRB- espite its familiar subject matter , Ice Age is consistently amusing and engrossing ...
1519	4	a	Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .
2622	3	a	Brosnan is more feral in this film than I 've seen him before and Halle Berry does her best to keep up with him .
2693	4	a	An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .
5400	3	a	This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
2257	2	a	There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .
2636	3	a	It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems .
5105	1	a	Aan opportunity wasted .
8170	2	a	... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
3946	4	a	Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .
4285	0	a	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
1726	3	a	Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .
7116	0	a	A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
4034	2	a	The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .
793	2	a	Thin period piece .
1579	4	a	A soul-stirring documentary about the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds .
6830	3	a	It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .
3970	1	a	Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
2459	0	a	It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
971	3	a	The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .
1145	1	a	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
2064	3	a	Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images .
672	3	a	Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .
7796	1	a	The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
988	1	a	A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- .
5778	0	a	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
7700	2	a	The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers .
3441	4	a	P.T. Anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible .
7987	1	a	One of those so-so films that could have been much better .
5269	1	a	Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .
82	2	a	The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .
2092	3	a	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
860	1	a	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
4185	3	a	Daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , Biggie and Tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation .
8055	4	a	The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .
2448	3	a	A hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life .
7201	3	a	The Lady and the Duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective .
2340	1	a	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
4639	2	a	Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment
2343	3	a	Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work .
2618	3	a	Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
555	1	a	This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
7394	3	a	... an interesting slice of history .
7972	4	a	Director Charles Stone III applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about Drumline is its energy .
7480	4	a	`` 13 Conversations About One Thing '' is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling .
1571	1	a	... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
6996	1	a	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
495	1	a	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
6351	1	a	Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
3985	2	a	Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .
963	3	a	This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .
6161	4	a	As satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago ... has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency .
7688	3	a	Well-made but mush-hearted .
3377	0	a	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
3024	3	a	It must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes .
949	3	a	For most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .
2258	0	a	Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
1214	3	a	Oh , look at that clever angle !
5782	1	a	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
7094	1	a	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
8099	0	a	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
4135	4	a	... a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs .
7960	2	a	Draggin ' about dragons
875	1	a	The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
7333	1	a	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
2873	1	a	Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
2047	0	a	Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
3507	4	a	Even better than the first one !
7497	1	a	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
3008	3	a	Confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of Barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .
599	4	a	The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .
5096	1	a	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
1809	3	a	-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .
6167	0	a	The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
2074	3	a	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
36	1	a	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
4466	3	a	The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them .
1725	4	a	Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .
8232	1	a	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
3884	4	a	The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .
6976	1	a	There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
3199	4	a	An effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .
2927	2	a	Every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .
1504	1	a	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
6361	1	a	What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .
543	4	a	The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .
3575	3	a	Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing .
6484	4	a	There 's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin
1681	2	a	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
766	0	a	A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .
2379	1	a	Conforms itself with creating a game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
5034	3	a	Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .
2712	3	a	If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .
6498	0	a	Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .
3722	4	a	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
4487	1	a	Not a strike against Yang 's similarly themed Yi Yi , but I found What Time ?
1441	2	a	In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .
4457	1	a	But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
5694	3	a	Confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk .
7508	2	a	Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle .
5219	3	a	May lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless .
7247	1	a	As saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
606	2	a	But I do .
6435	0	a	Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
7970	3	a	The closest thing to the experience of space travel
7674	1	a	It 's quite diverting nonsense .
5556	1	a	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
4363	4	a	It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
4791	4	a	A surprisingly funny movie .
5702	4	a	Uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year .
2581	3	a	Viva le Resistance !
4517	3	a	Savvy director Robert J. Siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .
6230	4	a	Most haunting about `` Fence '' is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen .
4901	1	a	This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
5559	1	a	The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
6801	0	a	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
5102	3	a	A superlative B movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing .
4602	3	a	Maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards .
7789	1	a	Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
5412	3	a	Schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .
7761	1	a	Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?
3147	1	a	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
2951	3	a	A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban Hades .
3242	1	a	With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low .
3604	0	a	As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
8151	4	a	Especially give credit to Affleck .
164	3	a	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
4760	3	a	Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes .
1523	3	a	It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .
3530	4	a	Better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of Jonathan Swift .
5152	3	a	You may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping .
8339	2	a	Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
764	4	a	You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions ; I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
2844	2	a	... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .
2803	1	a	Odd and weird .
1291	0	a	The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
5363	3	a	Audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .
3924	2	a	As it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .
4681	0	a	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
1270	4	a	Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .
7270	3	a	The leanest and meanest of Solondz 's misanthropic comedies .
6509	1	a	At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
2517	2	a	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
1216	2	a	This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .
135	4	a	One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .
3516	1	a	It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
4668	1	a	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
2061	2	a	About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .
2166	3	a	Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .
4805	4	a	With Dickens ' words and writer-director Douglas McGrath 's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told .
3920	4	a	Great character interaction .
5608	0	a	It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
2248	4	a	Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat 's Fat Girl , Rain is the far superior film .
3162	3	a	In Auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
1269	3	a	Rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
4520	3	a	In The Pianist , Polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way .
5431	1	a	overstylized
3303	1	a	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
4645	0	a	You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
4992	1	a	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
6613	4	a	It 's worth taking the kids to .
3326	0	a	All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .
1014	1	a	Includes too much obvious padding .
8179	3	a	Assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of Jacques Chardonne 's novel .
7331	4	a	Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
6009	2	a	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
911	3	a	The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .
6942	2	a	It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .
4721	1	a	At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
5457	3	a	I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
8316	3	a	With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
3432	1	a	I do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version .
5227	1	a	The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
3581	3	a	You do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate Scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works .
7675	1	a	Witless and utterly pointless .
2571	1	a	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
6865	3	a	The Komediant is a tale worth catching .
5426	2	a	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
7039	2	a	Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
7259	2	a	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
1917	3	a	Rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material .
8288	0	a	... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
1950	0	a	Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
7492	4	a	`` Simone '' is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality .
474	0	a	An extremely unpleasant film .
6059	3	a	It has plenty of laughs .
6974	1	a	... begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot .
6878	4	a	This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .
7672	0	a	Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
6078	2	a	You 'd think by now America would have had enough of plucky British eccentrics with hearts of gold .
1208	4	a	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .
7051	2	a	Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
178	4	a	Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .
2522	1	a	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
6740	3	a	A psychic journey deep into the very fabric of Iranian ... life .
2088	3	a	... strips Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults .
4695	3	a	Connoisseurs of Chinese film will be pleased to discover that Tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .
3451	1	a	Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
396	0	a	Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
8311	3	a	Poignant and funny .
8224	2	a	Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .
3218	2	a	In the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .
7246	2	a	Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .
778	1	a	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
3598	4	a	-LRB- Westbrook -RRB- makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
6072	2	a	Jarecki and Gibney do find enough material to bring Kissinger 's record into question and explain how the diplomat 's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .
2160	1	a	The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
3552	0	a	An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .
75	1	a	 
1644	1	a	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
3834	3	a	Has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre .
2489	4	a	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
6599	4	a	The most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` Jackass '' fan could want .
4088	2	a	It 's Jagger 's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite .
998	3	a	There 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to Lau .
7693	3	a	The gags are often a stitch .
2147	3	a	The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .
228	2	a	Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?
4954	0	a	No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
3252	4	a	For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .
7076	1	a	The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true .
2032	3	a	she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile
6642	3	a	At once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge .

2682	3	a	Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .
1538	3	a	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .
6560	1	a	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
4321	3	a	The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
4096	2	a	It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .

4401	1	a	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
31	0	a	Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
4912	3	a	Playfully profound ... and crazier than Michael Jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .
8327	1	a	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .

4436	3	a	Hardly a film that comes along every day .
7554	0	a	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
1651	2	a	That is because - damn it !
6478	3	a	Dogtown & Z-Boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of James Dean .
6201	2	a	It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
6324	4	a	In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .
6093	2	a	Nair does n't use -LRB- Monsoon Wedding -RRB- to lament the loss of culture .
35	1	a	They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .
7409	4	a	The movie is brilliant , really .
7742	2	a	It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .
1003	0	a	None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .

5980	1	a	Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .
1819	3	a	Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever .
2624	4	a	A thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .
7495	4	a	An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .

4464	3	a	The people in Jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out .
547	0	a	After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
2344	0	a	You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
8095	1	a	This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .
4995	1	a	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
432	2	a	A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .
2469	1	a	David Spade as Citizen Kane ?
5070	3	a	If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .
4701	2	a	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
8028	3	a	I am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from TV shows , but Hey Arnold !
4287	3	a	The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .

2188	4	a	Cho 's timing is priceless .
5236	4	a	Ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .
1703	4	a	It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
1705	2	a	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
7547	4	a	It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
6898	0	a	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
944	3	a	About Schmidt is Nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing King Lear .
5064	1	a	A high-minded snoozer .
4523	3	a	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
317	4	a	It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .
1133	1	a	Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
5062	3	a	A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A. 's show-biz and media subcultures .
273	2	a	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
7876	1	a	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
2516	2	a	The limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .
3087	3	a	It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
7160	3	a	I loved the look of this film .

7032	1	a	Leaks treacle from every pore .
1137	3	a	Good-naturedly cornball sequel .
7837	3	a	An off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .

5090	3	a	Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life .

2079	3	a	Far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year 's Kubrick-meets-Spielberg exercise .
8325	1	a	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
5515	4	a	A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .
4802	0	a	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .

4614	2	a	Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
8500	4	a	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
2790	3	a	It 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics .

5584	3	a	An average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains .

5243	4	a	Filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , Baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity .
6502	3	a	A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .
4480	3	a	It does give a taste of the Burning Man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity .
1376	3	a	The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .

5399	3	a	A compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .
4176	3	a	The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .

6557	3	a	Rubbo 's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy .
2646	1	a	While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .
181	3	a	Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama

6039	0	a	To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
2957	3	a	Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , Wendigo , Larry Fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .

3124	1	a	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
2133	3	a	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .

1910	3	a	Predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell .
1660	0	a	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
685	3	a	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
4109	1	a	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .

7456	2	a	A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .

1533	3	a	Wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film .
1166	3	a	Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .

714	3	a	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
6238	3	a	Although shot with little style , Skins is heartfelt and achingly real .
3407	3	a	Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .

2521	1	a	Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
2481	1	a	This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
3110	2	a	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
7786	1	a	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .

7398	1	a	I wanted more .
2388	2	a	foreshadowing
3505	3	a	It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
4646	1	a	A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
1957	2	a	Famuyiwa 's feature
2604	0	a	Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .
7023	3	a	It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .
6379	4	a	Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .
1701	3	a	Yet the act is still charming here .
5807	3	a	Like The Rugrats movies , The Wild Thornberrys Movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .
8138	3	a	Even through its flaws , Revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film .
7819	1	a	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
6289	3	a	The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
5415	2	a	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
5416	4	a	This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .
47	1	a	I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .
6312	2	a	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .
5324	3	a	I 'll go out on a limb .
4260	4	a	Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .
718	1	a	None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...
7071	2	a	Ana 's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she 's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her Rubenesque physique ...
3179	1	a	Thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .
684	3	a	When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .
1909	1	a	... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .
993	3	a	Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .
7602	2	a	The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
7163	1	a	And adults will at least have a dream image of the West to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle .
8043	2	a	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
1818	2	a	You just know something terrible is going to happen .
387	4	a	Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .
3169	3	a	A bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism .
1603	1	a	That 's because relatively nothing happens .
5429	3	a	An ambitious ` what if ? '
6826	4	a	The determination of Pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .
924	3	a	Another trumpet blast that there may be a New Mexican Cinema a-bornin ' . '
7461	2	a	Ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what - time-it-is tedious .
1155	3	a	Reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` Signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .
1435	4	a	The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .
7254	2	a	like a poor man 's You Can Count On Me
3626	1	a	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
7420	1	a	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .
713	2	a	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
5919	1	a	Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
3838	3	a	When you 've got the wildly popular Vin Diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .
5901	4	a	... even if you 've never heard of Chaplin , you 'll still be glued to the screen .
1627	1	a	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
6877	3	a	More good than great but Freeman and Judd make it work .
5764	2	a	Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
5659	2	a	The Ring is worth a look , if you do n't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment .
7980	2	a	Quelle surprise !
8003	1	a	At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
38	3	a	Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .
3181	1	a	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
759	4	a	From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
6523	1	a	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
7313	4	a	But believe it or not , it 's one of the most beautiful , evocative works I 've seen .
7865	2	a	I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .
5247	0	a	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
3987	0	a	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
106	4	a	One of recent memory 's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .
477	2	a	Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
3856	1	a	The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
4605	3	a	A faster paced family flick .
4087	3	a	The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .
5930	2	a	Underachieves only in not taking the Shakespeare parallels quite far enough .
5854	0	a	A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
5327	1	a	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
2490	2	a	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
5244	3	a	Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
7995	3	a	made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .
1105	3	a	Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .
2594	4	a	The movie is well crafted , and well executed .
7642	3	a	Directing with a sure and measured hand , -LRB- Haneke -RRB- steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .
2495	3	a	As relationships shift , director Robert J. Siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc .
7297	3	a	Apart from its own considerable achievement
7903	2	a	`` 13 Conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point .
6301	3	a	Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .
7723	3	a	An ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation .
4574	1	a	A mess .
3091	3	a	This kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .
5367	1	a	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
4008	2	a	The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .
5729	0	a	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
4314	2	a	You wo n't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again .
1474	1	a	Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
5451	1	a	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .
1044	2	a	All the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .
3088	4	a	... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ...
6594	4	a	Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity .
5183	1	a	Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
3520	1	a	Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
2500	3	a	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
5273	2	a	An unflinching look at the world 's dispossessed .
6724	3	a	Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering .
73	2	a	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
4575	2	a	A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
5830	0	a	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
2411	1	a	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
2851	1	a	The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
327	1	a	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
5154	0	a	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
384	4	a	Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .
6575	1	a	Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
1416	3	a	The tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals .
1303	2	a	Otherwise , maybe .
6602	4	a	Majidi 's direction has never been smoother or more confident .
5997	2	a	At its best -LRB- and it does have some very funny sequences -RRB- Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .
7191	0	a	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
3030	1	a	While easier to sit through than most of Jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
1431	1	a	Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on .
1235	1	a	Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .
431	2	a	Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?
7663	3	a	This cinema verite speculation on the assassination of John F. Kennedy may have been inspired by Blair Witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .
6245	4	a	Serious and thoughtful .
5086	2	a	It is not what you see , it is what you think you see .
1509	2	a	Oops , she 's really done it this time .
1615	0	a	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
410	1	a	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
2127	1	a	The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .
437	4	a	It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .
683	2	a	If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .
1289	1	a	Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
3358	1	a	This off-putting French romantic comedy

3966	3	a	The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
2186	2	a	Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
496	4	a	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
5887	2	a	`` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .
4353	3	a	By the end you ca n't help but feel ` stoked . '

6037	2	a	Ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled .
1343	3	a	By surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , Haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way .
631	3	a	From the opening strains of the Average White Band 's `` Pick up the Pieces '' , you can feel the love .
3677	3	a	A great companion piece to other Napoleon films .
13	3	a	Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense .
3018	4	a	A delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .

4194	3	a	Dog Soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it .
5454	4	a	To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
3135	4	a	With few respites , Marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in Moulin Rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it .
1822	1	a	This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .

2992	2	a	Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
1157	1	a	It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .

2757	1	a	The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
5447	2	a	Provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all .
5767	1	a	A movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
8115	0	a	Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
654	1	a	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
2227	2	a	A little objectivity could have gone a long way .
4361	4	a	While it 's nothing we have n't seen before from Murphy , I Spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort .
4253	3	a	Presents a side of contemporary Chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation .

1246	2	a	As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .
8153	4	a	It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .
7631	1	a	Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
6154	4	a	Very well-written and very well-acted .

3287	3	a	Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .

6677	1	a	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
7958	2	a	If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
7328	3	a	A modest masterpiece .
3845	4	a	Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .
4786	2	a	What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .
6168	4	a	The solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .

5274	1	a	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
1694	2	a	Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .
8376	2	a	The movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .

2729	2	a	There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
569	2	a	Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .
1515	3	a	It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .
4468	3	a	While Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .

5813	4	a	The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .

3810	2	a	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .

5586	3	a	Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
537	3	a	There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
2791	3	a	Even though many of these guys are less than adorable -LRB- their lamentations are pretty much self-centered -RRB- , there 's something vital about the movie .

4730	1	a	Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
3729	1	a	Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League .
1667	1	a	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
3526	3	a	This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .
5252	3	a	For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .
6146	3	a	A solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
8116	2	a	Debate it .
5528	0	a	Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
4943	4	a	The performances are remarkable .
2337	3	a	Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart .
4558	4	a	There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .

3885	2	a	Or intelligent .
578	3	a	A perceptive , good-natured movie .
1317	3	a	Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .
5469	2	a	A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .
868	2	a	Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .

3491	1	a	Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
7511	1	a	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
7915	3	a	It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .
1810	1	a	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .
3419	0	a	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
2990	3	a	Ice Age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up .
5230	4	a	A marvel of production design .

6121	1	a	Frida is n't that much different from many a Hollywood romance .

4765	3	a	One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace .
4956	1	a	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
2926	2	a	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
1472	1	a	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .
6704	4	a	A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .
4431	3	a	The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .
8190	3	a	It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .
1850	2	a	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
5076	3	a	- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
7499	0	a	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
4159	3	a	Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` A Walk to Remember '' succeeds through sincerity .
4817	0	a	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
2916	3	a	A sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity .
4564	1	a	It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
3202	3	a	` Blue Crush ' swims away with the Sleeper Movie of the Summer award .
7503	4	a	Will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year .
4123	3	a	Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .
1202	2	a	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
5238	0	a	... really horrible drek .
7690	3	a	Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .
5667	3	a	The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann .
7526	2	a	Made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age ... and then only as a very mild rental .
2888	1	a	Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
1931	1	a	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
7471	3	a	City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
4383	2	a	Like an episode of MTV 's Undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .
1542	2	a	The main problem being that it 's only a peek .
3629	4	a	Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .
5113	3	a	Great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex .
5627	2	a	You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
2479	1	a	But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .
7458	4	a	Cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .
7070	3	a	A mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama .
544	2	a	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
203	3	a	More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .
7754	0	a	Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
4283	2	a	But here 's a glimpse at his life .
7771	1	a	Lan Yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece .
1274	0	a	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
5572	2	a	Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for -LRB- and misses -RRB- .
84	4	a	Tells a fascinating , compelling story .
3742	0	a	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
5312	1	a	The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
1329	1	a	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
4412	2	a	There has to be a few advantages to never growing old .
3643	1	a	A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .

4366	3	a	A meditation on faith and madness , Frailty is blood-curdling stuff .
825	3	a	A remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive Eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
8527	1	a	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
3122	4	a	The cast is phenomenal , especially the women .
263	1	a	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
5666	2	a	There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
3253	3	a	As refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream .
8365	2	a	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .
5789	2	a	Although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing .
5233	1	a	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
1226	4	a	Compellingly watchable .
7626	3	a	Plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel .
2131	3	a	Bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent .
2027	1	a	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
2073	3	a	Stuffed to the brim with ideas , American instigator Michael Moore 's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .
3563	3	a	Ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory .
5366	3	a	A quasi-documentary by French filmmaker Karim Dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of Cuban music .
3280	3	a	A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe .
6876	2	a	The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
5558	2	a	Vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two English women .
6873	0	a	I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
7724	3	a	A literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit wo n't be disappointed .
5752	1	a	The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
3678	3	a	The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
306	1	a	A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
8031	2	a	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
2743	2	a	Pull -LRB- s -RRB- off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .
4795	3	a	Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy .
4522	1	a	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
5402	2	a	And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
6881	3	a	I liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .
4829	4	a	I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .
6624	1	a	Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .
4675	1	a	` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
2033	3	a	The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
6336	4	a	Scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar .
7013	2	a	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
2583	2	a	Spend your Benjamins on a matinee .
6918	2	a	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .
792	2	a	Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good , Freundlich 's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year .
4024	3	a	The performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .
2215	1	a	Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
6546	2	a	Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
132	1	a	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
4049	2	a	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
941	2	a	Sheridan
2360	1	a	Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
8137	1	a	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
404	3	a	`` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .
373	4	a	An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .
888	0	a	Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
8395	1	a	Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that Seagal 's overweight and out of shape .
986	1	a	Bland but harmless .
11	1	a	Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
6277	3	a	Deserves a place of honor next to Nanook as a landmark in film history .
5588	3	a	Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...
8204	3	a	It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .
6476	1	a	Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
8102	3	a	As I settled into my World War II memories , I found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .
156	3	a	Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .
6521	1	a	Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
4525	3	a	Rarely , a movie is more than a movie .
1918	1	a	For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .
2372	2	a	You have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie 's failings .
1763	0	a	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
7825	0	a	This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
7028	3	a	There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .
2700	2	a	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
1482	4	a	Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
1516	1	a	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .
2959	1	a	But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
6664	0	a	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
3703	3	a	Thoroughly enjoyable .
4611	4	a	The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .
8447	1	a	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
7605	0	a	Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
3760	1	a	Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
143	2	a	Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
4707	3	a	Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
8146	3	a	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
8453	3	a	This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .
7131	3	a	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
6388	1	a	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
4763	4	a	A beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in Korea .
5795	2	a	It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
7245	3	a	Roman Polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than ` Shindler 's List ' - it is more than merely a Holocaust movie .
6680	1	a	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .

6134	4	a	An immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .
1503	3	a	Throughout , Mr. Audiard 's direction is fluid and quick .
2745	3	a	Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
3844	4	a	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams , however , Robert Rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking .
2141	2	a	` All in all , Reign of Fire will be a good -LRB- successful -RRB- rental . '
324	4	a	See it .
148	2	a	Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .
7290	0	a	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
1497	3	a	Those who do n't entirely ` get ' Godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy .
3246	3	a	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
7978	2	a	Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?
8079	4	a	A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .
6494	3	a	A cutesy romantic tale with a twist .
4330	3	a	It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout .
25	2	a	It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .
3101	3	a	It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard French film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience .
6833	0	a	Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
3276	1	a	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
1481	3	a	But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .
307	2	a	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
7125	1	a	Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
441	2	a	Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .
4569	0	a	I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .
2374	2	a	The dramatic crisis does n't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but Huppert 's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience .
1762	2	a	Murder by Numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget .
856	1	a	A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
8109	1	a	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
5049	1	a	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
8478	4	a	A moving story of determination and the human spirit .
2171	2	a	It is there to give them a good time .
8089	0	a	Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
3454	1	a	I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .
8423	3	a	The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .
3431	3	a	Despite the film 's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving .
7557	3	a	The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting Mick Jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
3996	0	a	Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .
913	4	a	A captivating new film .
5185	1	a	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
7454	2	a	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
2657	1	a	Some episodes work , some do n't .
2382	4	a	A rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .
8302	1	a	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
955	3	a	What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .
5821	2	a	I 'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute .
2984	2	a	Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .
3235	1	a	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .
7289	1	a	... too sappy for its own good .
7244	2	a	A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .
6365	3	a	Simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , The Last Kiss is really all about performances .
8513	3	a	It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .
4359	4	a	It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .
4398	3	a	An undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band .
1857	0	a	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
726	2	a	Crikey indeed .
2184	1	a	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
3007	0	a	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
6621	0	a	It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
7620	0	a	It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
3489	2	a	It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
2223	1	a	Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .
6423	4	a	Not only does Spider-Man deliver , but I suspect it might deliver again and again .
1233	3	a	And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
4121	0	a	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
7773	3	a	Like its New England characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness .
6193	1	a	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
3488	1	a	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
4085	3	a	The Rock is destined to be the 21st Century 's new `` Conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jean-Claud Van Damme or Steven Segal .
7074	3	a	Niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in Hollywood , only God speaks to the press
7992	1	a	The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .
8132	3	a	That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .

3914	0	a	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
3776	4	a	Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than Barbershop .
3192	1	a	It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
5851	4	a	The case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .
8324	2	a	The movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
2602	1	a	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .

7711	0	a	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
8528	2	a	The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .

4238	3	a	While Bollywood\/Hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with Bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those -LRB- like me -RRB- who are n't .
1837	3	a	The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .
972	2	a	An often unfunny romp .
5442	2	a	Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .

6886	4	a	Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .

2971	3	a	Munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters .
2461	3	a	Although Olivier Assayas ' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation ... its three-hour running time plays closer to two .

6175	2	a	Suffice to say that after seeing this movie in IMAX form , you 'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of Tom Hanks ' face than his wife is .
4989	4	a	Extraordinary debut from Josh Koury .
1587	0	a	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .

6081	3	a	Some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .
991	3	a	The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .
7697	3	a	Beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , One Hour Photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures .

3036	3	a	There 's a spontaneity to The Chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout .
3436	3	a	This amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as Greenfingers ...
4938	0	a	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
4040	3	a	The film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing .
6894	1	a	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
4634	3	a	The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came .
2813	0	a	The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
6328	1	a	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .

7558	2	a	Mildly amusing .
7864	2	a	It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .
7657	3	a	Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski , it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .
4642	1	a	While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
473	4	a	An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .
5260	3	a	I could n't recommend this film more .
7355	2	a	A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .

7627	3	a	A vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior .
5554	1	a	Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .

6057	2	a	While certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
6714	3	a	While Cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it 's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem .
5440	3	a	A fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .

3004	3	a	Happy Times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it .
245	4	a	This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .

6084	4	a	Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real Americans '' make this a charmer .
1207	1	a	A party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid .
4762	2	a	With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
5540	1	a	Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
3800	0	a	This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
2549	0	a	The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
2135	1	a	Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
2253	3	a	If a big musical number like ` Praise the Lord , He 's the God of Second Chances ' does n't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids .
1082	2	a	The 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you ca n't fight your culture .
4874	3	a	The film reminds me of a vastly improved Germanic version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style .
7873	2	a	The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .
741	1	a	Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
7221	4	a	One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .
5617	1	a	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
1401	1	a	An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .
7660	3	a	A movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of Cho 's fans .
302	3	a	Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .
2464	2	a	An intriguing near-miss .
6474	4	a	See Scratch for the history , see Scratch for the music , see Scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .
5251	3	a	And the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence .
4235	3	a	The performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye .
1410	1	a	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
2265	3	a	-LRB- Woo 's -RRB- most resonant film since The Killer .

375	4	a	Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .
6750	3	a	One feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism .
3207	3	a	For all its problems ... The Lady and the Duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring ... which proves that Rohmer still has a sense of his audience .

5276	3	a	Too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -LRB- and better -RRB- than Pink Floyd tickets .
5533	1	a	Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .

4460	4	a	Watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy .

6641	1	a	Made to be Jaglomized is the Cannes Film Festival , the annual Riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money .
8113	0	a	The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .

3557	3	a	Surprisingly insightful
4073	4	a	Ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here 's betting her third feature will be something to behold .
6300	2	a	The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .
7781	2	a	Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .

1211	1	a	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
5678	3	a	Although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make Italian for Beginners worth the journey
5606	0	a	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
4677	2	a	Works because we 're never sure if Ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .
2800	2	a	Overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very Imaxy .

4779	3	a	Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing .

2561	1	a	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
1253	1	a	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .

1175	3	a	It 's still a comic book , but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul .
4751	1	a	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .

6218	3	a	Using an endearing cast , writer\/director Dover Kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred .
5800	2	a	Too ordinary to restore -LRB- Harmon -RRB- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .

524	2	a	-LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .
6688	1	a	Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .
7168	1	a	Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
7668	3	a	A sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .
2389	3	a	This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
1735	2	a	Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .
1095	1	a	An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets .
7782	0	a	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .

7319	3	a	The word that comes to mind , while watching Eric Rohmer 's tribute to a courageous Scottish lady , is painterly .
5893	1	a	Big mistake .
2502	3	a	Although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense .
3518	2	a	Igby Goes Down is one of those movies .
2163	3	a	Writer\/director Walter Hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable .
8119	3	a	But not without cheesy fun factor .
1514	1	a	-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
2840	3	a	Originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .
3706	3	a	The strength of the film lies in its two central performances by Sven Wollter as the stricken composer and Viveka Seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .

7327	3	a	A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .
232	1	a	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
6448	4	a	It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .
6273	2	a	Bang !
2786	2	a	`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .

3587	1	a	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .

8009	2	a	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
8100	3	a	The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul 's perspective .
6004	4	a	The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
1379	3	a	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
1828	1	a	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
6706	3	a	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
3764	1	a	There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
314	0	a	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
8346	2	a	Denis forges out of the theories of class - based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord .
4417	3	a	Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .
4377	2	a	With Rare Birds , as with The Shipping News before it , an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland 's wild soil -- and The Rock once again resists the intrusion .

8209	1	a	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
1125	4	a	Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft Ally McBeal-style fantasy sequences .
1018	1	a	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
527	3	a	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
7257	1	a	A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
5339	3	a	What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .
7623	4	a	It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .
4478	1	a	This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
1589	2	a	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
3725	1	a	It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
22	1	a	It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
2722	1	a	Too bad .
3134	1	a	It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
979	3	a	Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .
7345	2	a	Blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological .
7952	1	a	Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .

5207	4	a	Even if you 've seen `` Stomp '' -LRB- the stage show -RRB- , you still have to see this !
352	2	a	For a movie audience , The Hours does n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love .

8299	0	a	Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
7606	3	a	The acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans .
7022	2	a	Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .
1710	1	a	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .

7040	3	a	Remember it .
6998	3	a	This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .
4211	2	a	If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .
1006	1	a	Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
3979	3	a	The story line may be 127 years old , but El Crimen del Padre Amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment .

7190	3	a	Buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role .
583	3	a	And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after Greene 's story ends .
1117	1	a	Anemic , pretentious .
1677	4	a	It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
589	4	a	It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
2715	4	a	Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
29	2	a	More vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it 's inoffensive and actually rather sweet .
4676	3	a	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
4036	0	a	The film is all over the place , really .
3118	1	a	A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .
5001	3	a	Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
8118	4	a	Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .
8191	1	a	The chocolate factory without Charlie .
137	1	a	Although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up Catholic or , really , anything .
2009	2	a	underventilated
6380	3	a	Mr. Clooney , Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster .
1687	0	a	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
330	3	a	But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .
5373	1	a	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
2050	2	a	Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .
6027	0	a	I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
3561	2	a	has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
2955	1	a	These characters become wearisome .
5080	3	a	... certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes .
368	0	a	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
2748	3	a	A disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an Alice in Wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of TV 's Big Brother .
2060	0	a	Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
4656	2	a	Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
3445	3	a	George Lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension .
7219	0	a	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
4759	3	a	With We Were Soldiers , Hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the Vietnam War before the pathology set in .
3549	1	a	Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .
3727	0	a	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
4239	2	a	You could put it on a coffee table anywhere .
1969	4	a	The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .
6069	2	a	` Lovely and Amazing , ' unhappily , is neither ... excessively strained and contrived .
7108	1	a	Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .
6191	1	a	Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .
198	4	a	This is a superior horror flick .
2770	2	a	Would I see it again ?
3660	0	a	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
2125	3	a	Harmless fun .
7396	0	a	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
808	3	a	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
392	2	a	In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .
2988	2	a	The setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .
2218	0	a	Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
7170	3	a	Piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying .
3240	2	a	The funny thing is , I did n't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit .
358	2	a	Not as good as the original , but what is ...
1013	2	a	Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
486	0	a	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
1728	3	a	At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .
255	3	a	A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .
7676	2	a	Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .
5519	3	a	It 's sort of in-between , and it works .
6792	4	a	Last Orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced .
7592	3	a	Take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride .
755	3	a	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
7265	1	a	There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
1186	0	a	Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
6586	1	a	I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here .
3833	1	a	Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
2300	0	a	There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
5356	2	a	Creeps you out in high style , even if Nakata did it better .
7999	1	a	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
3822	4	a	A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
5115	1	a	Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
4773	4	a	You feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .
3352	0	a	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
4199	4	a	As a science fiction movie , `` Minority Report '' astounds .
130	1	a	Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
5609	3	a	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
2476	1	a	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
2675	2	a	Martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more .
7422	4	a	The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and Italy beckons us all .
2572	3	a	Expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women .
6131	1	a	Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp ca n't sustain it .
1080	0	a	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
7595	3	a	O Fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing .
3139	3	a	An engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line .
2877	2	a	With lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- Max is static , stilted .
4493	1	a	Austin Powers in Goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .
961	3	a	Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .
1758	0	a	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
5739	3	a	Skin Of Man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .
3638	1	a	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
446	2	a	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
5527	2	a	Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
2292	4	a	Daring and beautifully made .
1690	4	a	Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .
4538	3	a	A summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more .
1922	1	a	Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
4991	3	a	Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
6083	4	a	The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
802	3	a	Has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope .
1180	3	a	Hey , Happy !
2497	2	a	A minor work yet there 's no denying the potency of Miller 's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure .
5419	3	a	It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
3661	1	a	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
86	4	a	Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .
2567	0	a	One of the worst movies of the year .
4949	4	a	A smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy .
8060	0	a	Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
5537	0	a	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
90	2	a	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
3029	3	a	Certainly the big finish was n't something Galinsky and Hawley could have planned for ... but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .
89	1	a	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
1477	3	a	The film oozes craft .
1545	4	a	Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .
2206	0	a	It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
2063	4	a	Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .
1366	1	a	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
5732	1	a	A soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes ... almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of B-movie imagination .
7628	0	a	A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
5267	2	a	Marinated
700	1	a	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
1748	4	a	The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
5459	3	a	It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .
4094	1	a	Disjointed parody .
3566	1	a	At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
393	4	a	As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
7157	1	a	With the dog days of August upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
7091	3	a	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
2617	4	a	If you 're a comic fan , you ca n't miss it .
2316	3	a	Passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , Helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats .
1906	2	a	an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
4281	1	a	There 's an admirable rigor to Jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down .
5918	3	a	Secretary is just too original to be ignored .
5530	4	a	A remarkable film by Bernard Rose .
4800	4	a	Michael Moore 's latest documentary about America 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ...
2028	2	a	Ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .
7011	1	a	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
4628	3	a	The result puts a human face on Derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less .
5799	1	a	It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
3212	4	a	A powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall .
2601	2	a	What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?
250	3	a	The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .
4376	3	a	The film jolts the laughs from the audience -- as if by cattle prod .
1424	3	a	All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .
4778	1	a	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
125	3	a	If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
6107	2	a	Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
372	2	a	Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .
2823	3	a	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
5292	1	a	With elements cribbed from Lang 's Metropolis , Welles ' Kane , and Eisenstein 's Potemkin
1019	3	a	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .
2242	1	a	Almost peerlessly unsettling .
8229	3	a	There are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .
8460	2	a	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
1934	0	a	... a pretentious mess ...
4164	1	a	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
7710	3	a	Cinematic poetry showcases the city 's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything .
596	3	a	The difference is that I truly enjoyed most of Mostly Martha while I ne
3329	4	a	If you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular .
3891	3	a	... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams .
3216	1	a	The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .
2673	3	a	My Wife Is an Actress works as well as it does because -LRB- the leads -RRB- are such a companionable couple .
693	3	a	moved
7273	1	a	A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .
2266	3	a	Muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble .
8039	3	a	This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .
4537	2	a	Despite Hoffman 's best efforts , Wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .
2681	3	a	Terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life .
3321	0	a	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
5916	3	a	The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .
1053	2	a	-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
6180	0	a	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
5865	3	a	As chilling and fascinating as Philippe Mora 's modern Hitler-study , Snide and Prejudice .
611	3	a	... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
5184	1	a	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
3620	3	a	An entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the Bard 's immortal plays were written by somebody else .
2751	1	a	Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
6111	3	a	The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .
5938	4	a	Full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
965	3	a	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
1863	3	a	Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .
1335	3	a	Like many Western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about North Korea 's recent past and South Korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .
1541	3	a	Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .
1209	0	a	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
3251	4	a	A stylish thriller .
3151	2	a	What makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers .
6767	1	a	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
6101	1	a	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
6931	1	a	... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...
159	3	a	An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . '
956	2	a	Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
5801	3	a	A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .
1697	4	a	Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .
7384	2	a	That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
8328	2	a	The Sweetest Thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways .
4227	0	a	Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
8463	1	a	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
2932	1	a	` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
192	3	a	Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state .
869	3	a	God bless Crudup and his aversion to taking the easy Hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .
5191	0	a	Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
5321	2	a	A fascinating but choppy documentary .
6129	1	a	The movie is without intent .
2170	2	a	As Allen 's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator David Presson .
7823	4	a	Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
1469	0	a	If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
2979	3	a	There 's a lot to recommend Read My Lips .
3797	0	a	Utter mush ... conceited pap .
4732	3	a	Even with all its botches , Enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .
2190	2	a	It 's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a Southern Gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .
3846	4	a	The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons .
5798	1	a	An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
3444	3	a	A movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .
902	2	a	Almost .
739	1	a	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
7678	1	a	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
6246	0	a	Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
2249	0	a	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
4389	3	a	Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf .
7041	0	a	Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
3829	1	a	Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
8304	4	a	Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .
4492	4	a	A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable .
337	0	a	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
5597	4	a	A colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters .
4532	1	a	The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
702	3	a	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .
6179	3	a	What one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream .
6526	1	a	Two-bit potboiler .
4343	3	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , ' because it 's about family .
8486	2	a	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
7989	2	a	Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .
830	3	a	You need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes ' work .
1998	3	a	A French film with a more down-home flavor .
8208	2	a	`` On Guard ! ''
7179	2	a	This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong 's John Woo .
5668	1	a	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
5448	4	a	One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .
248	3	a	It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
457	1	a	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
